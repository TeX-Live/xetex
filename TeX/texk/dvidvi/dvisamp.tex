This program was written to help you do pagination tricks that are
difficult to do with \TeX\ under normal circumstances.  This program
can be used for tasks as simple as reversing the order of pages in a
{\tt dvi} file or selecting the even or odd pages.  It can be used
to print little cards like this, or brochures, by combining multiple
pages onto one page in some regular way.  You can print folded booklets
and many other things.  Enjoy!
