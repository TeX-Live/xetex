.SS Introduction
.PP
The dvidvi program converts a dvi file into another dvi file, with perhaps
certain changes.
.br
.SS Parameters
.PP
-f n      page n is first page selected
.br
-l n      page n is last page selected
.in +10
.ti -10
-n n      select at most n pages. Notice that n is the number of pages
selected, independently of the number of pages actually
contained in a sheet
.ti -10
-i { n1..n2 | n1 }[,...]
.br
include pages (ranges allowed). When this option is
used, ONLY the specified pages are selected. However,
we can exclude from these pages with the option -x
.ti -10
-x { n1..n2 | n1 }[,...]
.br
exclude pages (ranges allowed)
.ti -10
-q        work in quiet mode, that is do not print in the screen
messages of how the work is being done.
.ti -10
-r        reverse the order of the pages.
.PP
The page numbers for the above options -f -l -i and -x can be specified
in different ways.
.in +4
.ti -4
1)  If a number n is given, it is interpreted as the n'th page from the
beginning of the .dvi file. Of course, this number is independent of the
page number assigned by TeX.
.ti -4
2)  TeX page numbers are those who are actually written in the page;
these page numbers can be modified, for example, by using the TeX commands
\\pagenumbering, \\setcounter{page}{n}, and \\addtocounter{page}{n}.
A TeX page number can be specified by preceding the number n with the
character @. Thus, if you specify -f @25 -l @30 you select the pages
between 25 and 30, these numbers being those assigned by TeX.
.ti -4
3)  However, several pages can have the same TeX page number in a .dvi file.
For example, the introductory pages in a book are numbered i, ii, and so on
until the first chapter begins and then, the pages are numbered 1, 2, etc.
In this case, the pages numbered i and 1 in the .dvi file have the same TeX
page number. If you want to select for example the second occurrence of the
page numbered 1, you can specify a page number as (@2)1. Thus @1 is equivalent
to (@1)1. For example, if you specify -f (@2)1 -l(@2)10 you select the pages
between 1 and 10 of the first chapter, not the introductory pages between
i and x.
.PP
There is another parameter that tells dvidvi how you want to change page
layout and specifications.  This is the -m parameter.
.in +4
.ti -4
*   The number preceding the colon is the modulo value.  Everything will be
done in chunks of pages this big.  If there is no colon, than the default
value is assumed to be one.  The last chunk of pages is padded with as many
blank pages as necessary.
.ti -4
*   Following the colon is a comma-separated list of page numbers.  These
page numbers are with respect to the current chunk of pages, and must lie
in the range zero to the modulo value less one.  If a negative sign
precedes the number, then the page is taken from the mirror chunk; if there
are m chunks, then the mirror chunk of chunk n is the chunk numbered m-n-1.
Put simply, it is the chunk numbered the same, only from the end.  This can
be used to reverse pages.  If no number is given, the page number defaults
to 1.
.ti -4
*   Following each page number is an optional offset value in parenthesis,
which consists of a pair of comma-separated dimensions.  Each dimension is
a decimal number with an optional unit of measure.  The default unit of
measure is inches, or the last unit of measure used.  All units are in true
dimensions.  Allowable units of measure are the same that TeX allows: in,
mm, cm, pt, pc, dd, and cc.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.in +10
.ti -10
-m -      Reverses the order of the pages.  This time, both the modulo and the
page number are defaulted.
.ti -10
-m 2:0    Selects the first, third, fifth, etc. pages from the file.  Print
this one after printing the next, taking the paper out of the
feed tray and reinserting it into the paper feed.
.ti -10
-m 2:-1   Selects the second, fourth, etc. pages, and writes them in reverse
order.
.ti -10
-m 4:-1,2(4.25in,0in)
.ti -10
-m 4:-3,0(4.25in,0in)
.br
Useful for printing a little booklet, four pages to a sheet,
double-sided, for stapling in the middle.  Print the first one,
put the stack back into the printer upside down, and print the
second.  The `in' specifications are superfluous.
.ti -10
-m ,(1pt,1)
.br
Scare your system administrator!  Actually, things are so blurry with this
option, you may want to send enemies letters printed like this.  *Long*
letters.
.ti -10
-m 4:0(5.5in,4.25),3(0,4.25)
.ti -10
-m 4:1(0in,4.25),2(5.5,4.25)
.br
Print a four-page card on one sheet.  Print the first, rotate the paper 180
degrees and feed it again.  (PostScript people can do funny tricks with
PostScript so this isn't necessary.)
