Release notes for version 1.1 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.

This release adds t1lib support, which is good when installing with
teTeX. A man page is also now included. Finally color special support
has been fixed, and a few build issues too.

dvipng has gained its own project on SourceForge, so starting from
now, that project will be the main distribution point.

It has been tested to a fair degree. Note the disclaimer in the
COPYING file. Report any bugs you find, see README for instructions.
