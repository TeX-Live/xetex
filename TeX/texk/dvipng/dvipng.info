1 Introduction
**************

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX and
its relatives.

   It is intended to produce anti-aliased screen-resolution images as
fast as is possible. The target audience is people who need to generate
and regenerate many images again and again. The primary target is the
preview-latex (X)Emacs package, a package to preview formulas from
within (X)Emacs. Yes, you get to see your formulas in the (X)Emacs
buffer, see `http://preview-latex.sf.net'.

   Another example is WeBWorK, an internet-based method for delivering
homework problems to students over the internet, giving students
instant feedback as to whether or not their answers are correct, see
`http://webwork.math.rochester.edu'.

   Other applications may also benefit, like web applications as
latex2html and WYSIWYG editors like LyX.

   The benefits include

   * Speed. It is a very fast bitmap-rendering code for DVI files. On a
     fairly low-end laptop, it takes less than a second to generate 150
     one-formula images. This makes dvipng suitable for generating large
     amounts of images on-the-fly, as needed in preview-latex, WeBWorK
     and others.

   * It does not read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX
     finishes. There is a -follow switch that makes dvipng wait at EOF
     for further output, unless it finds the POST marker that indicates
     the end of the DVI.

   * Interactive query of options. dvipng can read options interactively
     through stdin, and all options are usable. It is even possible to
     change the input file through this interface.

   * Supports PK, VF, PostScript Type1, and TrueType fonts, color
     specials and simple PostScript inclusion specials.

   * and more...

2 Installation
**************

Installing dvipng should be simple: merely `./configure', `make', and
`make install'.

* Installation outside the texmf tree::
* Advice for non-privileged users::


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Prerequisites,  Next: Configure,  Up: Installation

2.1 Prerequisites
=================

   * The GD Graphics Draw library, libgd

     The one requirement that may be a problem is Thomas Boutell's
     `libgd', downloadable at `http://www.boutell.com/gd'. There are
     binary packages for at least RedHat linux from redhat.com, and
     probably also for several other operating systems from their
     distributors. The latest version of the library installs using
     `autoconf' so it should really not be more difficult to install
     than dvipng, but the `autoconf' support is quite new, though.

   * The path-searching library kpathsea

     Kpathsea is most likely included in your LaTeX installation, but
     it may happen that ./configure does not find it; see below. If you
     have not got it, download it from `http://www.ctan.org' and
     compile it.  I have no experience with this, so I cannot help much
     here.

   * FreeType 2

     While not strictly necessary, you may want to have FreeType 2
     available. Its presence will enable direct support for PostScript
     fonts in dvipng, rather than using `gsftopk' for rendering the
     fonts. If you have PostScript versons of Computer Modern
     installed, there will be no need to generate bitmapped variants on
     disk of these. Then, you can render images at different (and
     unusual) resolutions without cluttering the disk with lots of
     bitmapped fonts.

   * libpng and libz

     To be able to compress and write PNG files to disk, dvipng (or
     really libgd) uses libpng which in turn uses libz. These should be
     available on any modern system, if not, download them and install
     them.

   * The `texinfo' package

     This is needed for building the documentation.

2.2 Configure
=============

The first step is to configure the source code, telling it where
various files will be.  To do so, run

     ./configure OPTIONS

   (Note: if you have fetched dvipng from CVS rather than a regular
release, you will have to first generate `./configure' by running
`autoconf' 2.53 or later in the `preview' directory.)

   On many machines, you will not need to specify any options, but if
`configure' cannot determine something on its own, you'll need to help
it out. For a list of the options type

     ./configure --help

   On some machines, the libraries will be installed in nonstandard
directories that are not in the linker's search path. This will generate
an error when running `./configure', indicating that it cannot find
libgd or libkpathsea (most likely). You then need to specify the path to
the respective library's object files. They are typically called e.g.,
`libgd.a' or `libgd.so'. If they are located in e.g., `/sw/local/lib',
do

     ./configure LDFLAGS=-L/sw/local/lib

   If the library is available as a shared object file (`.so'), the
runtime linker may also need to be told where to find the library, then
use

     ./configure LDFLAGS='-L/sw/local/lib -R/sw/local/lib'

   When either of these is necessary, it is likely that the C header
files are also installed in nonstandard directories that are not in the
C preprocessor's search path. This will also generate an error when
running `./configure', indicating that it cannot find e.g., `gd.h' or
`kpathsea.h' (most likely). You then need to specify the path to the
respective library's C header files. If they are located in e.g.,
`/sw/local/include', do

     ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/local/include

   On my SUN Solaris workstation, I had to combine this into

     ./configure CPPFLAGS='-I/sw/local/include -I/sw/tex/teTeX/1.0/include'\
         LDFLAGS='-L/sw/local/lib -R/sw/local/lib -L/sw/tex/teTeX/1.0/lib/'

where the backslash denotes a continuation of the line.

2.3 Build/install
=================

Once `configure' has been run, simply enter

     make
   at the prompt to compile the C code, and build the documentation
files.  To install the files into the locations chosen earlier, type

     make install

You may need special privileges to install, e.g., if you are installing
into system directories.


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Installation outside the texmf tree,  Next: Advice for non-privileged users,  Prev: Build/install,  Up: Installation

2.4 Installation outside the texmf tree
=======================================

In some cases, a dvipng binary installed outside the texmf tree will not
be able to find virtual fonts, or the PostScript font maps (normally
used by dvips). This may be because one or more of $SELFAUTOLOC,
$SELFAUTODIR or $SELFAUTOPARENT are used in the texmf tree configuration
file `texmf.cnf'. If so, give the switch `--enable-selfauto-set' to
`./configure', which will make dvipng adjust these internally so that
kpathsea thinks that dvipng _is_ installed in the texmf tree.


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Advice for non-privileged users,  Prev: Installation outside the texmf tree,  Up: Installation

2.5 Installation for non-privileged users
=========================================

Often people without system administration privileges want to install
software for their private use. In that case you need to specify more
options to the `configure' script, usually this is done by using the
`--prefix' option to the `configure' script, and let it point to the
personal home directory. In that way, resulting binaries will be
installed under the `bin' subdirectory of your home directory, manual
pages under `man' and so on. That way, it is reasonably easy to
maintain a bunch of additional packages, since the prefix argument is
supported by most `configure' scripts.

   You'll have to add something like `/home/myself/bin' to your `PATH'
shell variable, if it isn't there already, and similarly set the
`INFOPATH' variable to be able to access the documentation.


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Basic usage,  Next: Command-line options,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

3 Basic usage of dvipng
***********************

To use dvipng at its simplest, simply type

     dvipng foo

where `foo.dvi' is the output of TeX that you want to convert to PNG
format. If there are four pages in `foo.dvi', those pages will be
output as `foo1.png', `foo2.png', `foo3.png', and `foo4.png',
respectively.

   If you have enabled the PostScript font support (via FreeType), fonts
will be rendered as they are needed. Otherwise, if you use fonts that
have not been used on your system before, they may be automatically
generated; this process can take a few minutes, so progress reports
appear by default.  The next time the same font is used, it will have
been saved on disk, so rendering will go much faster.  (If dvipng tries
to endlessly generate the same fonts over and over again, something is
wrong.  *Note Unable to generate fonts: (kpathsea)Unable to generate
fonts.)

   Many options are available (see the next section).  For a brief
summary of available options, just type

     dvipng --help

4 Command-line options
**********************

dvipng has a plethora of command line options.  Reading through this
section will give a good idea of the capabilities of the driver.

* Option details::              More information about each option.


File: dvipng.info,  Node: Option summary,  Next: Option details,  Prev: Command-line options,  Up: Command-line options

4.1 Option summary
==================

Here is a handy summary of the options; it is printed out when you run
dvipng with no arguments or with the standard `--help' option.

     This is dvipng 1.0 Copyright 2002-2004 Jan-Åke Larsson

     Usage: ./dvipng [OPTION]... FILENAME[.dvi]
     Options are chosen to be similar to dvips' options where possible:
       -D #         Output resolution
       -l #         Last page to be output
       --mode s     MetaFont mode (default 'cx')
       -M*          Don't make PK fonts
       -o f         Output file, '%d' is pagenumber
       -O c         Image offset
       -p #         First page to be output
       -pp #,#..    Page list to be output
       -q*          Quiet operation
       -r*          Reverse order of pages
       -t c         Paper format (also accepts e.g., '-t a4')
       -T c         Image size (also accepts '-T bbox' and '-T tight')
       -v*          Verbose operation
       -x #         Override dvi magnification
       -            Interactive query of options

     These do not correspond to dvips options:
       -bd #        Transparent border width in dots
       -bdpi #      Set the base (Metafont) resolution
       -bg s        Background color (TeX-style color)
       --depth*     Output the image depth on stdout
       --dvinum*    Use TeX page numbers in output filenames
       -fg s        Foreground color (TeX-style color)
       --follow*    Follow mode
       --height*    Output the image height on stdout
       --t1lib*     T1lib font rendering (default on)
       --truecolor* Truecolor output
       -Q #         Quality (T1lib and PK subsampling)
       -z #         PNG compression level

        # = number   f = file   s = string  * = suffix, '0' to turn off
            c = comma-separated dimension pair (e.g., 3.2in,-32.1cm)

4.2 Option details
==================

Many of the parameterless options listed here can be turned off by
suffixing the option with a zero (`0'); for instance, to turn off page
reversal, use `-r0'.  Such options are marked with a trailing `*'.

`-'
     Read additional options from standard input after processing the
     command line.

`--help'
     Print a usage message and exit.

`--version'
     Print the version number and exit.

`-bd NUM'
     Set the pixel width of the transparent border (default 0). Using
     this option will make the image edges transparent, but it only
     affects pixels with the background color.

`--bdpi NUM'
     Set the base (Metafont) resolution, both horizontal and vertical,
     to NUM dpi (dots per inch). This option is neccessary when manually
     selecting Metafont mode with the -mode option (see below)

`-bg COLOR SPEC.'
     Choose background color for the images. This option will be
     ignored if there is a background color \special in the DVI. The
     color spec should be in TeX syntax, e.g., 'rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0'. See
     *Note Color::.

`-d NUM'
     Set the debug flags, showing what dvipng (thinks it) is doing.
     This will work unless dvipng has been compiled without the `DEBUG'
     option (not recommended).  *Note Debug options::, for the possible
     values of NUM.  Use `-d -1' as the first option for maximum output.

`-D NUM'
     Set the output resolution, both horizontal and vertical, to NUM
     dpi (dots per inch).

     One may want to adjust this to fit a certain text font size (e.g.,
     on a web page), and for a text font height of FONT_PX pixels (in
     Mozilla) the correct formula is
          DPI = FONT_PX * 72.27 / 10 [px * TeXpt/in / TeXpt]
     The last division by ten is due to the standard font height 10pt in
     your document, if you use 12pt, divide by 12. Unfortunately, some
     proprietary browsers have font height in pt (points), not pixels.
     You have to rescale that to pixels, using the screen resolution
     (default is usually 96 dpi) which means the formula is
          FONT_PX = FONT_PT * 96 / 72 [pt * px/in / (pt/in)]
     On some high-res screens, the value is instead 120 dpi. Good luck!

`--depth*'
     Report the depth of the image. This only works reliably when the
     LaTeX style `preview.sty' from preview-latex is used. It reports
     the number of pixels from the bottom of the image to the baseline
     of the image. This can be used for vertical positioning of the
     image in, e.g., web documents, where one would use (Cascading
     StyleSheets 1)
          <IMG SRC="FILENAME.PNG" STYLE="vertical-align: -DEPTHpx">
     The depth is a negative offset in this case, so the minus sign is
     necessary, and the unit is pixels (px).

`-fg COLOR SPEC.'
     Choose foreground color for the images. This option will be
     ignored if there is a foreground color \special in the DVI. The
     color spec should be in TeX syntax, e.g., 'rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0'. See
     *Note Color::.

`--follow*'
     Enable follow mode. One of the benefits of dvipng is that it does
     not read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX finishes.
     This switch makes dvipng wait at EOF for further output, unless it
     finds the POST marker that indicates the end of the DVI. This is
     similar to `tail -f' but for DVI-to-PNG conversion.

`--freetype*'
     Enable/disable FreeType font rendering (default on). This option is
     available if the FreeType2 font library was present at compilation
     time.  If this is the case, dvipng will have direct support for
     PostScript Type1 and TrueType fonts in dvipng, rather than using
     `gsftopk' for rendering the fonts. If you have PostScript versons
     of Computer Modern installed, there will be no need to generate
     bitmapped variants on disk of these. Then, you can render images
     at different (and unusual) resolutions without cluttering the disk
     with lots of bitmapped fonts.

`--height*'
     Report the height of the image. This only works reliably when the
     LaTeX style `preview.sty' from preview-latex is used. It reports
     the number of pixels from the top of the image to the baseline of
     the image. The total height of the image is obtained as the sum of
     the values reported from -height and the -depth.

`-l [=]NUM'
     The last page printed will be the first one numbered NUM. Default
     is the last page in the document.  If NUM is prefixed by an equals
     sign, then it (and the argument to the `-p' option, if specified)
     is treated as a physical (absolute) page number, rather than a
     value to compare with the TeX `\count0' values stored in the DVI
     file.  Thus, using `-l =9' will end with the ninth page of the
     document, no matter what the pages are actually numbered.

`--mode MODE'
     Use MODE as the Metafont device name for the PK fonts (both for
     path searching and font generation). This needs to be augmented
     with the base device resolution, given with the `--bdpi' option.
     See the file `ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/modes.mf' for a list of
     resolutions and mode names for most devices. With the default
     paths, explicitly specifying the mode also makes the program
     assume the fonts are in a subdirectory named MODE. *Note TeX
     directory structure: (kpathsea)TeX directory structure. If
     Metafont does not understand the MODE name, see *Note Unable to
     generate fonts: (kpathsea)Unable to generate fonts.

`-M*'
     Turns off automatic PK font generation (`mktexpk'). This will have
     no effect when using PostScript fonts, since no PK font generation
     will be done anyway.

`-o NAME'
     Send output to the file NAME. A single occurrence of `%d' or
     `%03d' will be exchanged for the TeX page number. The default
     output filename is `FILE%d.png' where the input DVI file was
     `FILE.dvi'.

`-O X-OFFSET,Y-OFFSET'
     Move the origin by X-OFFSET,Y-OFFSET, a comma-separated pair of
     dimensions such as `.1in,-.3cm'.  The origin of the page is
     shifted from the default position (of one inch down, one inch to
     the right from the upper left corner of the paper) by this amount.

`-p [=]NUM'
     The first page printed will be the first one numbered NUM. Default
     is the first page in the document.  If NUM is prefixed by an
     equals sign, then it (and the argument to the `-l' option, if
     specified) is treated as a physical (absolute) page number, rather
     than a value to compare with the TeX `\count0' values stored in the
     DVI file.  Thus, using `-p =3' will start with the third page of
     the document, no matter what the pages are actually numbered.

`-pp FIRSTPAGE-LASTPAGE'
     Print pages FIRSTPAGE through LASTPAGE; but not quite equivalent
     to `-p FIRSTPAGE -l LASTPAGE'. For example, when rendering a book,
     there may be several instances of a page in the DVI file (one in
     `\frontmatter', one in `\mainmatter', and one in `\backmatter').
     In case of several pages matching, `-pp FIRSTPAGE-LASTPAGE' will
     render _all_ pages that matches the specified range, while `-p
     FIRSTPAGE -l LASTPAGE' will render the pages from the _first_
     occurrence of FIRSTPAGE to the _first_ occurrence of LASTPAGE.
     This is the (undocumented) behaviour of dvips. In dvipng you can
     give both kinds of options, in which case you get all pages that
     matches the range in `-pp' between the pages from `-p' to `-l'.
     Also multiple `-pp' options accumulate, unlike `-p' and `-l'.  The
     `-' separator can also be `:'. Note that `-pp -1' will be
     interpreted as "all pages up to and including 1", if you want a
     page numbered -1 (only the table of contents, say) put `-pp -1--1',
     or more readable, `-pp -1:-1'.

`-q*'
     Run quietly.  Don't chatter about pages converted, etc. to standard
     output; report no warnings (only errors) to standard error.

`-Q NUM'
     Set the quality to NUM. That is, choose the number of antialiasing
     levels for PK fonts to be NUM*NUM. The default value is 3 which
     gives 9 levels of antialiasing for antialiased PK fonts.

`-r*'
     Toggle output of pages in reverse/forward order. By default, the
     first page in the DVI is output first.

`-t PAPERTYPE'
     Set the paper type to PAPERTYPE.  You can also specify a PAPERTYPE
     of `landscape', which rotates a document by 90 degrees. To rotate
     a document whose paper type is not the default, you can use the
     `-t' option twice, once for the paper type, and once for
     `landscape'.

`-T HSIZE,VSIZE'
     Set the paper size to (HSIZE,VSIZE), a comma-separated pair of
     dimensions such as `.1in,-.3cm'.  It overrides any paper size
     special in the DVI file.

`--truecolor*'
     On systems with a fairly new `libgd', one can choose to generate
     truecolor output. This will not be necessary in general unless you
     include truecolor images via a PostScript special (i.e., the
     `graphics' or `graphicx' package). It will lead to longer
     execution time, mostly because more data is written to disk.

`-v*'
     Enable verbose operation. This will currently indicate what fonts
     is used, in addition to the usual output.

`-x NUM'
     Set the x magnification ratio to NUM/1000. Overrides the
     magnification specified in the DVI file.  Must be between 10 and
     100000.  It is recommended that you use standard magstep values
     (1095, 1200, 1440, 1728, 2074, 2488, 2986, and so on) to help
     reduce the total number of PK files generated.  NUM may be a real
     number, not an integer, for increased precision.

`-z NUM'
     Set the PNG compression level to NUM. This option is enabled if
     your `libgd' is new enough. The default compression level is 1,
     wich selects maximum speed at the price of slightly larger PNGs.
     For an older `libgd', the hard-soldered value 5 is used. The
     include file `png.h' says

          Currently, valid values range from 0 - 9, corresponding
          directly to the zlib compression levels 0 - 9 (0 - no
          compression, 9 - "maximal" compression). Note that tests have
          shown that zlib compression levels 3-6 usually perform as
          well as level 9 for PNG images, and do considerably fewer
          calculations. In the future, these values may not correspond
          directly to the zlib compression levels.

The `-d' flag to dvipng helps in tracking down certain errors.  The
parameter to this flag is an integer that tells what errors are
currently being tracked.  To track a certain class of debug messages,
simply provide the appropriate number given below; if you wish to track
multiple classes, sum the numbers of the classes you wish to track.  To
track all classes, you can use `-1'.

   Some of these debugging options are actually provided by Kpathsea
(*note Debugging: (kpathsea)Debugging.).

   The classes are:
1
     Normal dvi op-codes

2
     Virtual fonts

4
     PK fonts

8
     TFM files

16
     Glyph rendering

32
     FreeType calls

64
     Encoding loads

128
     Color specials

256
     GhostScript specials

512
     Kpathsea `stat' calls

1024
     Kpathsea hash table lookups

2048
     Kpathsea path element expansion

4096
     Kpathsea path searches

5.2 Including graphics fails
============================

The most common problem with including graphics is an incorrect bounding
box.  Complain to whoever wrote the software that generated the file if
the bounding box is indeed incorrect.

6 Color
*******

To support color, dvipng recognizes a certain set of specials. These
specials start with the keyword `color' or the keyword `background',
followed by a color specification.

6.1 Color specifications
========================

The color specification supported by dvipng is the name of a color model
(initially, one of `rgb', `hsb', `cmyk', or `gray') followed by the
appropriate number of parameters. Thus, the color specification `rgb
0.3 0.4 0.5' would correspond to the color that is `0.3 0.4 0.5' in its
red, blue and green values.

6.2 Color specials
==================

We will describe `background' first, since it is the simplest. The
`background' keyword must be followed by a color specification.  That
color specification is used as a fill color for the background. The
last `background' special on a page is the one that gets used, and is
used for the whole of the page image. (This is possible because the
prescan phase of dvipng notices all of the color specials so that the
appropriate information can be written out during the second phase.)

   The `color' special itself has three forms. The first is just
`color' followed by a color specification. In this case, the current
global color is set to that color; the color stack must be empty when
such a command is executed.

   The second form is `color push' followed by a color specification.
This saves the current color on the color stack and sets the color to be
that given by the color specification.  This is the most common way to
set a color.

   The final version of the `color' special is just `color pop', with
no color specification; this says to pop the color last pushed on the
color stack from the color stack and set the current color to be that
color.
