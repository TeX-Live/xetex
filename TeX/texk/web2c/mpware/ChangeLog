2004-07-23  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* makempx.in: Have TROFF use -Tps instead of -Tpost, as the former
	is what GROFF uses.

	* dmp.c: Changes to support groff (which is the most likely
	candidate for being actually used these days).
	(hash): Use unsigned char to calculate hash value.
	(get_int_map): Variant of get_int() that will accept octal and hex
	values.
	(get_float_map): Variant of get_float() that actually just skips over
	the (comma-separated) list.
	(scan_desc_line): Use get_int_map() and get_float_map() where
	relevant.
	(set_string): Set a word, to implement groff's 't' directive.
	(do_graphic): Ignore 'Fd'.
	(do_x_cmd): Account for groff's scaling.
	(do_page): Account for groff's scaling.  Implement (or ignore)
	additional groff commands 'F', 'm', 'u' (aborts), 't'.
	(dmp_usage): Modify help text.
	These changes were suggested by Michail Vidiassov
	<master@iaas.msu.ru>.

2004-07-14  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* mpto.c (main): Second argument to usagehelp.

2004-06-19  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* makempx.in: Since the trap statement is already quoted, the
	quotes around $ERRLOG must be escaped.  Found by Werner Lemberg
	<wl@gnu.org>.

	* makempx.in: Forgot the filename in the sed command.

	* makempx.in: If the mpxerr.tex begins with a %&-line, get the
	name of the program to use from it.  The default 'tex' has become
	a problem now that 'latex' requires the 'etex' engine.  Reported
	by Lars Madsen <daleif@imf.au.dk>.

2004-04-16  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* makempx.in: Tell eqn to format for 'post' terminal, just like
	troff is told to do.  The asusmption here is that when troff
	supports -Tpost, eqn does as well.  From Michail Vidiassov
	<master@iaas.msu.ru>.

	* mpto.c: According to CSTR #54 the ".lf" directive should be ".lf
	%d %s", not ".lf line %d %s" as used in the original code.  Found
	by Michail Vidiassov <master@iaas.msu.ru>.

2003-02-15  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* Makefile.in: From klibtool to libtool.  Based on patches from
	Albert Chin-A-Young <china@thewrittenword.com>.

	* makempx.in: We might as well be consistent in the use of '
	versus ".

2003-02-07  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* makempx.in: Add --parse-first-line to arguments of "default"

	* Version 7.0.

Mon Dec  9 01:31:55 1996  Ulrik Vieth  <vieth@thphy.uni-duesseldorf.de>

	* makempx.in: Use `basename $0` in usage and version messages 
	for consistency with other programs and scripts.

	* makempx.in: Fix a confusion between TROFF_INERR and TROFF_OUTERR.

	* makempx.in: Remove unfinished $MPXFILE if an error occurs rather
	than leaving behind a broken version that might confuse $NEWER.

	* newer.c, mpto.c, dmp.c: Reformat usage message for consistency.
	
	* newer.c (main): Back out unnecessary usage() function again.
	All cases of incorrect input were already caught before.

	* mpto.c (main): Issue "Need exactly one file arg. Try --help" 
	message if called with no arguments.
 	
	* dmp.c (main): Issue "Need one or two file args. Try --help"
 	message if called with no arguments.
	This makes it impossible to use dmp as a filter reading from
 	stdin, but it's more in line with the behavior of dvitomp.

	* dmp.c (main): Exit after perror() if file opening failed.
  	This might have been the reason for some remaining seg faults.
	
Tue Dec  3 18:06:46 1996  Ulrik Vieth  <vieth@thphy.uni-duesseldorf.de>

	* makempx.in: Must use `eval $TROFF' to get the `eqn | troff'

        standalone programs instead of $(LOADLIBES), a la squeeze

        (usage): Have a -E option on the Amiga.
        From Andreas Scherer.

Sat Sep 30 15:56:47 1995  Karl Berry  <karl@cs.umb.edu>

Thu Apr 13 16:40:08 1995  Ulrik Vieth  <vieth@thphy.uni-duesseldorf.de>

	* makempx, troffmpx: replaced by templates makempx.in, troffmpx.in.

	by the actual installation directory $(bindir), which is known to
	the Makefile when invoked as a sub-make from the top-level Makefile.

	* newer.c: include "c-auto.h" as a replacement for "site.h".

	* mptotex.c, mptotr.c: no changes needed. 

	* dvitomp.ch: complete rewrite, incorporating material from

	specific stuff that isn't found in "c-auto.h".  Use MPSUPPORT
	instead of MPPOOL as the directory for troff support files.

	* dmp.h.in: added new template file for "dmp.h". The actual header
	file is produced by sed, repacing @TEXMF@ by the actual library
	directory $(texmf), which is known to the Makefile when invoked
	as a sub-make from the top-level Makefile.

	* pathexp.c: include "c-auto.h" as a replacement for "site.h".
	Use `#ifdef HAVE_DIRENT_H' and `#ifdef HAVE_STRING_H' instead

	that needs to be checked.)
