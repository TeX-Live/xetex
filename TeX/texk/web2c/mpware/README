This directory is for the small C programs and shell scripts used by
MetaPost to do TeX-ing for captions and so forth.

It seems cleaner to put this stuff in a separate directory than mix it
in with the WEB sources at the top level. Either way is painful. This
way, all the .c files at the top level are generated and can be removed
in one shot.
