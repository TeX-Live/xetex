% weave.ch for C compilation using web2c.
%
%  11/29/82 HWT Original version. This modifies weave to allow a new
%               control sequence:
%                       @=...text...@>   Put ...text... verbatim on a line
%                                        by itself in the Pascal output.
%                                        (argument must fit on one line)
%               This control sequence facilitates putting #include "gcons.h"
%               (for example) in files meant for the pc compiler.
%               Also, there is a command line option, -c, which means that
%               only the modules affected by the change file are to generate
%               TeX output.  (All the limbo stuff still goes to the output
%               file, as does the index and table of contents.)
%  2/12/83 HWT  Brought up for use with version 1.3.  Uses Knuth's new
%               control sequences for verbatim Pascal (as above, without
%               the "on one line" part), and the force_line (@\) primitive.
%               Also, he added stuff to keep track of changed modules, and
%               output enough information that macros can choose only to
%               print changed modules.  This isn't as efficient as my
%               implementation because I avoided outputting the text for
%               non-changed modules altogether, but this feature won't be
%               used too often (just for TeX and TeXware), so Knuth's
%               solution is accepted.
%               The change file changes that used
%               to implement these features have been removed.
%               There is a -x flag to cause WEAVE to omit cross referencing
%               of identifiers, and index and T.of.C. processing.
%               This, too, is unnecessary, for one could simply redefine some
%               WEB macros to avoid the printing, but there are only a couple
%               of easy changes, so they have been made.
%  2/18     HWT Increased stack size to 400 (not for TeX-related programs).
%  3/18     HWT Brought up for Version 1.5.  Made it print newline at end of
%               run.
%  4/13     PC  Merged with Pavel's version, including adding a call to
%               exit() at the end of the program, based upon the value of
%               `history'.
%  4/16     PC  Brought up to version 1.5 released with TeX 0.97 in April 1983
%  6/29     HWT Brought up to version 1.7 released with TeX 0.99 in June 1983,
%		introducing a new change file format
%  7/17	    HWT Brought up to version 2.0 released with TeX 0.999 in July 1983
%  7/29     HWT Brought up to version 2.1
% 11/17     HWT Brought up to version 2.4 released with TeX 1.0.  Made
%		changes to use C routines for I/O, for speedup.
%  1/31     HWT Brought up to version 2.6
%  12/15/85 ETM Brought up to version 2.8
%  03/15/88 ETM Converted for use with WEB to C, and for version 2.9 of Weave.
%  11/30/89 KB  Version 4.

@x [264] System-dependent changes.
This module should be replaced, if necessary, by changes to the program
that are necessary to make \.{WEAVE} work at a particular installation.
It is usually best to design your change file so that all changes to
previous modules preserve the module numbering; then everybody's version
will be consistent with the printed program. More extensive changes,
which introduce new modules, can be inserted here; then only the index
itself will get a new module number.
