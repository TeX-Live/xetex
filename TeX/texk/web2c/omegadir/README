This directory contains part of the Omega distribution, other parts
are found in ../otps, and several files in the parent directory.  You
will also need odvips, the sources of which might be present in
../../odvips.

Omega is very much experimental software, and may prove hard or
impossible to build on your system.  At present, you need to install
bison (the GNU version of yacc) and lex or flex to build otp2ocp from
scratch.  If you do not have these programs, you can try to use the
y_tab.c-dist, y_tab.h-dist, and lex.yy.c-dist files to complete the
build.
