.SH NAME
etex, einitex, evirtex \- extended TeX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B etex
.RI [ options ]
.RI [\fB& format ]
.RI [ file [ .tex ]\ |\ [\fB\e commands ]]
.\"=====================================================================
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run the e-\*(TX typesetter on
.IR file ,
usually creating
.IR file.dvi .
Instead of a filename, a set of e-\*(TX commands can be given, the first
of which must start with a backslash.
With a 
.BI & format
argument e-\*(TX uses a different set of precompiled commands,
contained in
.IR format.fmt ;
it is usually better to use the
.B -fmt
.I format
option instead.
.PP
e-\*(TX is the first concrete result of an international research &
development project, the NTS Project, which was established under the
aegis of DANTE e.V. during 1992. The aims of the project are to
perpetuate and develop the spirit and philosophy of \*(TX, whilst
respecting Knuth's wish that \*(TX should remain frozen.
.PP
e-\*(TX can be used in two different modes: in
.I compatibility mode
it is supposed to be completely interchangable with standard \*(TX.
In
.I extended mode
several new primitives are added that facilitate (among other things)
bidirectional typesetting.
.PP
An extended mode format is generated by prefixing the name of the
source file for the format with an asterisk (*).  Such formats are
often prefixed with an `e', hence
.B etex
as the extended version of
.B tex
and
.B elatex
as the extended version of
.BR latex .
However,
.B eplain
is an exception to this rule.
.PP
The
.B einitex
and
.B evirtex
commands are e-\*(TX's analogues to the
.B initex
and
.B virtex
commands.  In this installation, they are symbolic links to the
.B etex
executable.  These symbolic links may not exist at all.
.PP
e-\*(TX's handling of its command-line arguments is similar to that of
the other \*(TX programs in the
.I web2c
implementation.
.\"=====================================================================
.SH OPTIONS
This version of e-\*(TX understands the following command line options.
.TP
.BI -fmt \ format
.rb
Use
.I format
as the name of the format to be used, instead of the name by which
e-\*(TX was called or a
.I %&
line.
.TP
.B -enc
.rb
Enable the enc\*(TX extensions.  This option is only effective in
combination with
.BR -ini .
For documentation of the enc\*(TX extensions see
.BR http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html .
.TP
.B -file-line-error
.rb
Print error messages in the form
.I file:line:error
which is similar to the way many compilers format them.
.TP
.B -no-file-line-error
.rb
Disable printing error messages in the
.I file:line:error
style.
.TP
.B -file-line-error-style
.rb
This is the old name of the
.B -file-line-error
option.
.TP
.B -halt-on-error
.rb
Exit with an error code when an error is encountered during processing.
.TP
.B -help
.rb
Print help message and exit.
.TP
.B -ini
.rb
Start in
.I INI
mode, which is used to dump formats.  The
.I INI
mode can be used for typesetting, but no format is preloaded, and
basic initializations like setting catcodes may be required.
.TP
.BI -interaction \ mode
.rb
Sets the interaction mode.  The mode can be either
.IR batchmode ,
.IR nonstopmode ,
.IR scrollmode ,
and
.IR errorstopmode .
The meaning of these modes is the same as that of the corresponding
\ecommands.
.TP
.B -ipc
.rb
Send DVI output to a socket as well as the usual output file.  Whether
this option is available is the choice of the installer.
.TP
.B -ipc-start
.rb
As
.BR -ipc ,
and starts the server at the other end as well.  Whether this option
is available is the choice of the installer.
.TP
.BI -jobname \ name
.rb
Use
.I name
for the job name, instead of deriving it from the name of the input file.
.TP
.BI -kpathsea-debug \ bitmask
.rb
Sets path searching debugging flags according to the bitmask.  See the
.I Kpathsea
manual for details.
.TP
.BI -mktex \ fmt
.rb
Enable
.RI mktex fmt ,
where
.I fmt
must be either
.I tex
or
.IR tfm .
.TP
.B -mltex
.rb
Enable ML\*(TX extensions.  Only effective in combination with
.BR -ini .
.TP
.BI -no-mktex \ fmt
.rb
Disable
.RI mktex fmt ,
where
.I fmt
must be either
.I tex
or
.IR tfm .
.TP
.BI -output-comment \ string
.rb
Use
.I string
for the
.I DVI
file comment instead of the date.
.TP
.BI -output-directory \ directory
.rb Write output files in
.I directory
instead of the current directory.  Look up input files in
.I directory
first, the along the normal search path.
.TP
.B -parse-first-line
.rb
If the first line of the main input file begins with
.I %&
parse it to look for a dump name or a
.B -translate-file
option.
.TP
.B -no-parse-first-line
.rb
Disable parsing of the first line of the main input file.
.TP
.BI -progname \ name
.rb
Pretend to be program
.IR name .
This affects both the format used and the search paths.
.TP
.B -recorder
.rb
Enable the filename recorder.  This leaves a trace of the files opened
for input and output in a file with extension
.IR .fls .
.TP
.B -shell-escape
.rb
Enable the
.BI \ewrite18{ command }
construct.  The
.I command
can be any shell command.  This construct is normally
disallowed for security reasons.
.TP
.B -no-shell-escape
.rb
Disable the
.BI \ewrite18{ command }
construct, even if it is enabled in the
.I texmf.cnf
file.
.TP
.B -src-specials
.rb
Insert source specials into the
.I DVI
file.
.TP
.BI -src-specials \ where
.rb
Insert source specials in certain placed of the
.I DVI
file.
.I where
is a comma-separated value list:
.IR cr ,
.IR display ,
.IR hbox ,
.IR math ,
.IR par ,
.IR parent ,
or
.IR vbox .
.TP
.BI -translate-file \ tcxname
.rb
Use the
.I tcxname
translation table to set the mapping of input characters and
re-mapping of output characters.
.TP
.BI -default-translate-file \ tcxname
.rb
Like
.B -translate-file
except that a
.I %&
line can overrule this setting.
.TP
.B -version
.rb
Print version information and exit.
.\"=====================================================================
.SH ENVIRONMENT
See the Kpathsearch library documentation (the `Path specifications'
node) for precise details of how the environment variables are used.
The
.B kpsewhich
utility can be used to query the values of the variables.
.PP
One caveat: In most e-\*(TX formats, you cannot use ~ in a filename you
give directly to e-\*(TX, because ~ is an active character, and hence is
expanded, not taken as part of the filename.  Other programs, such as
\*(MF, do not have this problem.
.PP
.TP
TEXMFOUTPUT
Normally, e-\*(TX puts its output files in the current directory.  If
any output file cannot be opened there, it tries to open it in the
directory specified in the environment variable TEXMFOUTPUT.
There is no default value for that variable.  For example, if you say
.I etex paper
and the current directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT has
the value
.IR /tmp ,
e-\*(TX attempts to create
.I /tmp/paper.log
(and
.IR /tmp/paper.dvi ,
if any output is produced.)
.TP
TEXINPUTS
Search path for
.I \einput
and
.I \eopenin
files.
This should probably start with ``.'', so
that user files are found before system files.  An empty path
component will be replaced with the paths defined in the
.I texmf.cnf
file.  For example, set TEXINPUTS to ".:/home/usr/tex:" to prepend the
current direcory and ``/home/user/tex'' to the standard search path.
.TP
TEXFORMATS
Search path for format files.
.TP
TEXPOOL
search path for
.B etex
internal strings.
.TP
TEXEDIT
Command template for switching to editor.  The default, usually
.BR vi ,
is set when e-\*(TX is compiled.
.TP
TFMFONTS
Search path for font metric
.RI ( .tfm )
files.
.\"=====================================================================
.SH FILES
The location of the files mentioned below varies from system to
system.  Use the
.B kpsewhich
utility to find their locations.
.TP
.I etex.pool
Text file containing e-\*(TX's internal strings.
.TP
.I texfonts.map
Filename mapping definitions.
.TP
.I *.tfm
Metric files for e-\*(TX's fonts.
.TP
.I *.fmt
Predigested e-\*(TX format (.\|fmt) files.

.SH NOTES
This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete
documentation for this version of e-\*(TX can be found in the info
manual
.IR "Web2C: A TeX implementation" .
.\"=====================================================================
.SH BUGS
This version of e-\*(TX implements a number of optional extensions.
In fact, many of these extensions conflict to a greater or lesser
extent with the definition of e-\*(TX.  When such extensions are
enabled, the banner printed when e-\*(TX starts is changed to print
.B e-TeXk
instead of
.BR e-TeX .
.PP
This version of e-\*(TX fails to trap arithmetic overflow when
dimensions are added or subtracted.  Cases where this occurs are rare,
but when it does the generated
.I DVI
file will be invalid.

.RB ( web2c ),
originally written by Tomas Rokicki and Tim Morgan.
