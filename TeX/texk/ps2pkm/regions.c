:h4.GOING_TO() - Macro Predicate Needed for Changing Direction, Etc.
 
The actual generation of run end lists (edge boundaries) is left
to the low level rasterizing modules, LINES and CURVES.  There
are some global region-type
questions that occur when doing a low-level
rasterization:
:ol.
:li.Did we just change direction in Y and therefore need to start
a new edge?
:li.Did we run out of allocated edge space?
:li.Do the minimum or maximum X values for the current edge need
updating?
:eol.
In general the REGIONS is not smart enough to answer those questions
itself.  (For example, determining if and when a curve changes direction
may need detailed curve knowledge.)  Yet, this must be done efficiently.
We provide a macro "GOING_TO" where the invoker tells us where it is
heading for (x2,y2), plus where it is now (x1,y1), plus the current
region under construction, and the macro answers the questions above.

:h3 id=edgelist.The "edgelist" Structure
 
Regions are represented by a linked list of 'edgelist' structures.
When a region is complete, the structures are paired, one for the
left and one for the right edge.  While a region is being built,
this rule may be violated temporarily.
 
An 'edgelist' structure contains the X values for a given span
of Y values.  The (X,Y) pairs define an edge.  We use the crack
and edge coordinate system, so that integer values of X and Y
go between pels.  The edge is defined between the minimum Y and
maximum Y.
 
The linked list is kept sorted from top to bottom, that is, in
increasing y.  Also, if 'e1' is an edgelist structure and 'e2' is the
next one in the list, they must have exactly the same ymin,ymax values
or be totally disjoint.  These two requirements mean that if e2's ymin
is less than e1's ymax, it must be exactly equal to e1's ymin.  A
sublist of structures with identical ymin and ymax values is called a
'swath'.
 
In addition, edgelist structures are separately linked together based
on what subpath originally created them; each subpath is kept as a
separate circular linked list.  This information is ignored unless
continuity checking is invoked.  See :hdref refid=subpath. for a
complete description of this.
*/
 
 
/*SHARED LINE(S) ORIGINATED HERE*/
 
/*
The "edgelist" structure follows the convention of TYPE1IMAGER user
objects, having a type field and a flag field as the first two
elements.  However, the user never sees "edgelist" structures
directly; he is given handles to "region" structures only.
 
By having a type field, we can use the "copy" feature of Allocate()
to duplicate edge lists quickly.
 
We also define two flag bits for this structure.  The ISDOWN bit is set
if the edge is going in the direction of increasing Y. The ISAMBIGUOUS
bit is set if the edge is identical to its neighbor (edge->link); such
edges may be "left" when they should be "right", or vice versa,
unnecessarily confusing the continuity checking logic.  The FixSubPaths()
routine in HINTS will swap ambiguous edges if that avoids crossing edges;
see :hdref refid=fixsubp..

:h3.SortSwath() - Vertically Sort an Edge into a Region
 
This routine sorts an edge or a pair of edges into a growing region,
so that the region maintains its top-to-bottom, left-to-right form.
The rules for sorting horizontally may vary depending on what you
are doing, but the rules for vertical sorting are always the same.
This routine is passed an argument that is a function that will
perform the horizontal sort on demand (for example, swathxsort() or
SwathUnion()).
 
This is a recursive routine.  A new edge (or edge pair) may overlap
the list I am building in strange and wonderful ways.  Edges may
cross.  When this happens, my strategy is to split the incoming edge
(or the growing list) in two at that point, execute the actual sort on
the top part of the split, and recursively call myself to figure out
exactly where the bottom part belongs.

wrong, region-breath!  For performance, the X values associated with an
edge are allocated contiguously with it.  So, we free the X values when
we free a structure.  However, once an edge has been split, we are no
longer sure which control block actually is part of the memory block
that contains the edges.  Rather than trying to decide, we play it safe
and never free part of a region.
 
So, to mark a 'edgelist' structure as discarded, we move it to the end
