:h1.ARITH Module - Portable Module for Multiple Precision Fixed Point Arithmetic
 
This module provides division and multiplication of 64-bit fixed point
numbers.  (To be more precise, the module works on numbers that take
two 'longs' to store.  That is almost always equivalent to saying 64-bit
numbers.)
 
Note: it is frequently easy and desirable to recode these functions in
assembly language for the particular processor being used, because
assembly language, unlike C, will have 64-bit multiply products and
64-bit dividends.  This module is offered as a portable version.

Knuth talks about a 'digit' being an arbitrary sized unit and a number
being a sequence of digits.  We'll take a digit to be a 'short'.
The following assumption must be valid for these algorithms to work:
:ol.
:li.A 'long' is two 'short's.
:eol.
The following code is INDEPENDENT of:
:ol.
:li.The actual size of a short.
:li.Whether shorts and longs are stored most significant byte
first or least significant byte first.
:eol.
 
SHORTSIZE is the number of bits in a short; LONGSIZE is the number of
bits in a long; MAXSHORT is the maximum unsigned short:
