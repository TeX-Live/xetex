This are the sources as I have found them on the X11R5 distribution. In
order to use them for my purpose (ps2pk: conversion tool for Type1 fonts to
packed TeX fonts) a number of changes were needed (see Changelog).

Changelog (the main-line):
--------------------------
92-02: Start of ps2pk project
       - decoupling Type1 library from X11 (changes in t1intf.h + t1funcs.h;
         added Xstuff.h to replace X header files)
       - user definable encoding schemes (removed hardwired ISOLatin1 and
         Symbol encodings from t1funcs.c and replaced by encoding paramater
         in Type1OpenScalable)
92-03: First release 1.0 (pre-release)
92-04: - added expansion and slanting features as suggested by Lee
         Hetherington (changes in spaces.c, t1funcs.c)
       - changed t1test.c in order to test above features; added ISOLatin1
	 encoding vector.
       - README2 replaced by CHANGES (this file)
       - MSDOS concession (thanks to Sebastian Rahtz): renamed
	 fontfilest.h to ffilest.h so it does not clash with fontfile.h
	 (affects: fontfilest.h (->ffilest.h), t1funcs.c, t1info.c and
	 t1test.c).
       - MSDOS concession: all file extensions .c.orig and .h.orig renamed
	 to .crg respectivally .hrg
       - patch to handle /negationslash and /mapsto from LucidaMath-Symbol
         correctly in t1funcs.c (ILH: Lee Hetherington).
92-05: AMIGA/Aztec:
       - added type1.ami (contains order of objects in library)
       - added Makefile.ami
       - added bstring.c (contains a bzero()) 
92-05: - fixed a reference to a NULL pointer in t1info.c
       - more verbose error messages in type1 library (NDW: Norman Walsh)
       - changed memory heuristic in type1 library from static (one chunk)
         into dynamic (up to a maximum of 10 chunks). This was needed for
	 big fonts like daysrib.pfa (reported by Norman Walsh).
	 (Changes in t1funcs.c and t1malloc.c)
       - added Makefile.tcc for MSDOS/Turbo C, removed Makefile.dos
92-06: - added Makefile.djg for MSDOS/GCC 386 (djgpp)
       - fixed bug in t1io.c so MSDOS can read its own .pfb format
92-08: - fixed alligment problem for machines with wordlength other than 32
	 bits (patch in util.c). Reported by J"urgen Marenda
	 <marenda@ford.uni-koblenz.de> for DataGeneral AViiON (Motorola
	 M88k machine)
       - The type1 library did not render Oblique fonts correctly.
	 Erik Schenk <schenk@cpsc.ucalgary.ca> provided a patch for
	 this problem (patches in fontfcn.c and t1util.c).
       - Official X11.5 patches (Stephen Gildea 920728) merged in the type1
         library version of ps2pk. These patches were available on:
       	   export.lcs.mit.edu:/pub/R5/contrib-fixes/Type1.patch
       - portability: index() in t1info.c replaced by strchr()
94-01: Version 1.4 (bug fix release)
       - types.h: added basic type definitions for non 32-bit platforms
       - fontfcn.c: made `virtual memory' management dynamically
         (reported by Norman Walsh, needed for complicated fonts)
       - Makefile.*: improved
       - original X11R5 sources no longer included (see X11R5 sources if
         you want to see them)
       - t1malloc.c removed, not longer needed.
