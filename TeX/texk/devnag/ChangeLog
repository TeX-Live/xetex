 Version 2.0 of devnag is the first major revision of the program
 since its original release. It is based on version 1.6 (there are
 no releases 1.7, 1.8 or 1.9).

 Version 2.01 is a bugfix release, containing two changes in
 coding. (1) Previous versions of devnag have output "[" and "]"
 for Devanagari half-"sa and half-gha. Under some circumstances
 this can interact badly with LaTeX, and the form of output has
 been changed to avoid the problem. (2) \cline has been added to
 the list of LaTeX commands which devnag knows how to handle.
