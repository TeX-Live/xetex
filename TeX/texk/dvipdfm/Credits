   The kpathsea library is an essential part of dvipdfm (and all Web2c-based
TeX utilities). Thanks to Karl Berry and Olaf Weber for developing this and
making it available.

   Thanks to Cesar Crusius for encouraging me to support MetaPost output and
for providing sample code.

   Thanks to sevearl unnamed people for submitting bug reports.  Thanks
especially to those who tracked down problems and contributed
patches---Akiro Kakuto and Tommy Ekola.

   Thanks to those who have worked hard to provide support for dvipdfm in
other Tex/LaTeX packages---Cesar Crucius, D.P. Story, Donald Knuth, Hans
Hagan, and especially Sebastian Rahtz. I apologize for anyone who I have
neglected to mention.
