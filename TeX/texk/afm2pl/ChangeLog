Feb 16 2004
  Release 0.7
  * Preparation for inclusion in teTeX/TeX Live source tree.
  * .lig is now separate filetype; this required patches in the
    kpathsea library. They now reside under $TEXMF/fonts/lig/afm2pl.
  * Some encoding vectors have been removed because they are already
    available within teTeX/TeX Live.
  * The non-kpathsea version is no longer maintained: I no longer test
    it, and I also removed the afmtotfm script.
  * Names of switches conform now as much as possible to afm2tfm
  * Temporarily added fontinst support files. If and when afm2pl gets
    built-in, virtual-font based smallcaps and letterspacing these files
    will be removed.
