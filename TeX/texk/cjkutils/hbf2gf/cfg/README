In this directory you find some hbf2gf configuration files for common CJK
bitmap fonts.

No paths are specified for the HBF files -- under web2c you should add the
path for these fonts to the `MISCFONTS' variable in texmf.cnf; under emTeX
you should set the environment variable `HBFONTS'.

The font paths used here in the config files of this directory are TDS
compliant; only the `HBF_TARGET' environment variable is used (an example
would be `set HBF_TARGET=/usr/local/TeX/texmf/fonts').
