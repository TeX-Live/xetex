NAME
       deweb - strips away C & CWEB commands from CWEB sources

SYNOPSIS
       deweb [ file1 file2 ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       deweb  filters  away  all  C  &  CWEB commands from a CWEB
       source  code.  This  leaves  only  the  LaTeX  code.  This
       stripped  code,  in turn, may then be passed to a suitable
       syntax checker for LaTeX,  like  ChkTeX  and  lacheck,  or
       spell-checkers like ispell.

       The  chkweb tool, included in the ChkTeX distribution will
       do just this; writing similar scripts should be trivial.

       When deweb strips away the C code from your  CWEB  source,
       it  tries  to  preserve  line breaks.  This means that the
       error reports  from <your favorite tool> will  be  correct
       regarding to line numbers. In most cases, the column posi­
       tion will also be correct. This  significantly  simplifies
       finding the errors in the LaTeX source (in contrast to the
       output from cweave, which output  is  truly  difficult  to
       figure anything out from).

       deweb  accepts  a  list of filenames on the argument line,
       and will send its output to stdout.  If no  filenames  are
       given,  it  will  read  from stdin, acting as a filter. No
       options are currently accepted.

       Macho users may try to pipe the output from deweb directly
       into  LaTeX,  theoretically,  this should work. This would
       ease the debugging of the  LaTeX  code  significantly,  as
       when LaTeX complains about wrong syntax, you'll be able to
       find the erroneous line much  more  easily.  Don't  expect
       that  the  output  looks  very  much  like  the final one,
       though.

       deweb should now understand all correct CWEB  opcodes.  If
       it  complains  about  not  understanding a correct opcode,
       please inform the author.

BUGS
       Doesn't  even  compile under Perl versions before perl v5.
       Unfortunately, this means that we can't even tell the user
       why  we  failed;  Perl  will just complain about not being
       able to compile the regexps.

       The program will try to swallow the whole  input  file  at
       once, instead of processing it on a line-by-line basis.
