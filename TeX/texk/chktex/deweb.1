.SH NAME
deweb \- strips away C & CWEB commands from CWEB sources
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B deweb
[
.B file1 file2 ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I deweb
filters away all C & CWEB commands from a CWEB source code. This
leaves only the
.I LaTeX
code. This stripped code, in turn, may then
be passed to a suitable syntax checker for LaTeX, like
.I ChkTeX
and
.I lacheck,
or spell-checkers like
.I ispell.
.PP
The
.I chkweb
tool, included in the 
.I ChkTeX
distribution will do just this; writing similar scripts should be
trivial.
.PP
When
.I deweb
strips away the C code from your CWEB source, it tries to preserve line breaks.
This means that the error reports  from
.I <your favorite tool>
will be correct regarding to line numbers. In most cases,
the column position
will also be correct. This significantly simplifies
finding the errors in the
.I LaTeX
source (in contrast to the output from
.I cweave,
which output is truly difficult to figure anything out from).
.PP
.I deweb
accepts a list of filenames on the argument line, and will send its output
to
.I stdout.
If no filenames are given, it will read from stdin, acting as
a filter. No options are currently accepted.
.PP
Macho users may try to pipe the output from
.I deweb
directly into
.I LaTeX,
theoretically, this should work. This would ease the debugging
of the
.I LaTeX
code significantly, as when
.I LaTeX
complains about wrong syntax, you'll be able to find the erroneous
line much more easily. Don't expect that the output looks very much
like the final one, though.
.PP
.I deweb
should now understand all correct
.I CWEB
opcodes. If it complains about not understanding a correct opcode,
please inform the author.

.B cweave(1), perl(1), chktex, lacheck(1), ispell(1)
.SH BUGS
Doesn't even
.B compile
under
.I Perl
versions before perl v5. Unfortunately, this means that we can't even
tell the user why we failed;
.I Perl
will just complain about not being able to compile the regexps.
.PP
The program will try to swallow the whole input file at once, instead of
processing it on a line\-by\-line basis.
