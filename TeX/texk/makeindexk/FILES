If you receive MakeIndex by ftp or from any distribution tape, you can
ignore this file because you should have the complete version.  This
file explains what you should receive by mail on a file by file basis.
There is a shell script that will send the files listed below to you
automatically.  This facility is intended for people with no access to
other distribution channels.

What follows is a subset of the current MakeIndex distribution.  It
contains the following files for important info about MakeIndex:

FILES   README   CONTRIB   ACK   COPYING   PORTING

This distribution includes the file test.tex, which is a documentation
written by Leslie Lamport on the use of MakeIndex with LaTeX.  Nelson
Beebe added index terms to the document, so that you can try out
MakeIndex with the test.idx file generated by running LaTeX on
test.tex.  Also included is makeindex.l, which is a UNIX man page on
the general use of MakeIndex.

You should also receice the following files, which comprise the full
MakeIndex source directory.

		Makefile.kcc	Makefile.vms	mkind.c		scanid.h
		Makefile.msc	VMSmake.com	mkind.h		scanst.c
LOG		Makefile.pcc	genind.c	qsort.c		scanst.h
Makefile	Makefile.unx	genind.h	scanid.c	sortid.c

Altogether, you should receive 26 messages, each containing one file,
from this automatic mail distribution of MakeIndex.
