		----- MakeIndex Porting Note -----

You are welcome and encouraged to port MakeIndex to any system not
support under the current distribution.  The standard way of doing
that is by adding patches with enclosed #ifdef ... #endif pairs.  You
can invent your own variables with the OS_ prefix attached in the
front.  Please report your port back to me, so that I can make it
available to other people.
