% Put %i in the command line where the input file name should go.
% Put %o in the command line where the output file name should go.
% (dvipdfm must be able to supply the output file name to your
% command line)
% Put %b in the line somewhere if you want to specify the
% "base" name of the input file, e.g., "foo" instead of "foo.eps"

% Note that it's probably a good idea to fully qualify
% the paths so you can be sure what you are running

% 0x0004 (Revision 2) Print the document.
%        (Revision 3) Print the document (possibly not at the highest quality
%        level, depending on whether bit 12[0x0800] is also set).
% 0x0008 Modify the contents of the document by operations other than those
%        controlled by bits 6[0x0020], 9[0x0100], and 11[0x0400].
% 0x0010 (Revision 2) Copy or otherwise extract text and graphics from the
%        document, including extracting text and graphics (in support of
%        accessibility to disabled users or for other purposes).
%        (Revision 3) Copy or otherwise extract text and grphics from the
%        document by operations other than that controlled by bit 10[0x0200].
% 0x0020 Add or modify text annotations, fill in interactive form fields,
%        and, if bit 4[0x0008] is also set, create or modify interactive
%        form fields (including signature fields).
%
% (Revision 3 only)
% 0x0100 Fill in existing interactive form fields (including signature
%        fields), even if bit 6 is clear.
% 0x0200 Extract text and graphics (in support of accessibility to disabled
%        users or for other purposes).
% 0x0400 Assemble the document (insert, rotate, or delete pages and create
%        bookmarks or thumbnail images), even if bit 4 is clear.
% 0x0800 Print the document to a representation from which a faithful digital
%        copy of the PDF content could be generated. When this bit is clear
%        (and bit 3 is set), printing is limited to a low-level representation
%        of the appearance, possibly of degraded quality.
