This directory contains Dvipsk, my (kb@mail.tug.org) modified version of
Tom Rokicki's dvips, a DVI-to-PostScript translator.

See `NEWS' for major changes by release, `ChangeLog` for all changes.
See `INSTALL' for installation instructions.
See `../kpathsea/BUGS' for details on reporting bugs.
AT LEAST NEWS, ChangeLog, AND INSTALL ARE WOEFULLY OUT OF DATE.

Aside from configuration, this differs from the original primarily in
that it uses the same code for path searching as TeX and my other
distributions.

Dvipsk does not install any default config.ps file, since no one file is
generally suitable. Sample Dvips config files are in the contrib/
directory. See ./INSTALL.

The documentation is now in Texinfo format.  I've removed the font
naming section, since it was an old version of the font naming document
(which you can get from ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/fontname/).

Dvipsk is free software; Tom's original files are public domain.  The
files I wrote (originally for the Free Software Foundation) are covered
by the GNU General Public License -- see the files COPYING*.

You can get the original dvips from ftp://labrea.stanford.edu/pub/dvips*.

dvips 5.86 notes:

   Minor improvements to epsf style file.
   Another patch to t1part.c to make it more liberal in accepting pfb/pfa
      font files.
   Added PS reencoding reimplementation by Rob Hutchings.
   Added 'F' in config file to send controlD.
   Added quick exit if -? or -v.
   Improved tex.lpro to fix a bug that showed up in distiller.
   Improved tex.lpro to work around a problem in certain Windows
      environments.
   Made dvips complain if it had to section a document.
   Eliminated use-after-free bug in hps.c.
   Fixed a problem in t1part for the Euro fonts with partial font downloading.
   Fixed a big problem in t1part for some font downloading due to
      uninitialized allocations.
   Added `unknown' paper size back to config.ps.
   Made t1part munge the UniqueID to prevent cache problems in Acrobat and
      other programs.
   Fixed parsing error when whitespace following '<' in psfonts.map.
   Made '<<' work correctly (disable partial font downloading for that
      particular font) in psfonts.map.

dvips 5.74 notes:

   The epsf.sty and epsf.tex files are now in the public domain.
   The t1part.c has been updated to support binary files with
   multiple binary sections.

dvips 5.72 notes:

   Bug fix in t1part.c???  I hope so!

   Debugging now turned on by default.  No real reason to turn it off.
   (Too many Linux versions of dvips without debugging have been
   distributed, and it makes it very difficult to help the users with
   their problems . . .)

dvips 5.62 notes:

   The makefile and config.ps and MakeTeXPK need to be modified to fit
   your site!

   dvips.tex needs updating.

To document:
   Landscape mfmode
   HPS integration
   Separate EPSF file generation
   Better bbox support
   Partial type 1 support
   Comment elision now turned *off*
   Upleveling of font requirements
   Bitmap font descriptions

Questions:
   Should I eliminate PStfms/PSvfs/afm-extra?
   Should I eliminate PSlatex?  (my guess is yes)
   Partial type 1 downloading (Sergey Lesenko)
   HyperTeX support (Mark Doyle)
   Lots of little bugs/changes/fixes

Still todo:

- Make a better copyfile that handles Level 2 data better
- Add landscape mode def and code to select it.
- Sanitize; test on various systems
- Improve makefile!!!  Goal:  on a standard C installation (with stdlib
  and all) and a Unix machine using TDS, make it be just a `make' away.
- Improve diagnostics, especially when files not found.
- Eliminate `extern' declarations; use header files properly

Despite the fact that I reference Mark and Sergey, bugs are mine, mine,
all mine, so please bug me and not them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
All real documentation is now in the file dvips.tex.  There is also a file
called test.tex that you can read and run to test some basic capabilities of
dvips.  INSTALLATION has the primary installation instructions.
