This is a collection of Chinese encoding maps which can be used with
ttf2pt1. They are moved to a separate archive due to their size which
is much bigger than ttf2pt1 itself and because not everyone would
need them.

Versioning policy:
These map files have no direct dependency on the ttf2pt1 version (starting
with ttf2pt1 3.2.2 which is the first version supporting multi-plane maps).
But some changes may happen in future, as well as the supported map
formats may change. To avoid unneccessary extra releases on one hand
and keep the updates in sync with the ttf2pt1 itself on the other hand, a new 
version of these map files will be released only if there are any changes to 
them and these releases will be given the same version number as ttf2pt1 
released at the same time. So not every release of ttf2pt1 would have a 
corresponding release of the Chinese maps. For example, to get the correct 
version of the Chinese maps for an imaginary release 8.3.4 of ttf2pt1 you 
would need to look for Chinese maps of the highest version not higher than 
(but possibly equal to) 8.3.4.
