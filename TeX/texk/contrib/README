This directory contains: replacement mktex... programs which emulate
the mktex... shell scripts in ../kpathsea directory; a replacement for
the makempx script from ../web2c/mpware; and a replacement for the
dvihp script from ../dviljk.  These C programs are primarily for use
in those environments where the standard Unix shell and utilities
invoked by the scripts are not readily available.  However, they can
also be used on Unix platforms, although they were tested almost
exclusively on MS-DOS and MS-Windows systems.

Caveats: currently, the emulation programs don't support edited *.opt
files, they emulate internally the effect of the original *.opt files
distributed with Web2c sources.  Variables set from the mktex.cnf file
*are* supported.

All of the programs except dvihp.c were written by Fabrice Popineau
<popineau@esemetz.ese-metz.fr>.  dvihp.c was written by Eli Zaretskii
<eliz@is.elta.co.il>.

See `INSTALL' for instructions to build and install.
