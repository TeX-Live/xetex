To build the replacement programs, chdir to this directory and type
"make".  This builds the main programs mktex, makempx and dvihp, and
the mktex... programs which are really symlinks to mktex.

To install the compiled programs, copy them all into the same directory
where you install the other binaries ($prefix/bin, which is usually
/usr/local/bin).

The supplied Makefile was tested with DJGPP, but it should also work
with any reasonable Unix setup.  For platforms other than these two,
you might need to tweak the Makefile a bit; the macros $EXE, $O, $LN_S
and $RM are provided to make this easier.
