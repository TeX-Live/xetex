a2ping is a UNIX command line utility written  in  Perl  that  converts  many
  raster  image  and  vector  graphics  formats  to  EPS  or PDF and other page
  description formats. Accepted input file formats are: PS  (PostScript),  EPS,
  PDF, PNG, JPEG, TIFF, PNM, BMP, GIF, LBM, XPM, PCX, TGA. Accepted output 
  formats are: EPS, PCL5, PDF, PDF1, PBM, PGM, PPM, PS, markedEPS, markedPS,  
  PNG, XWD,  BMP,  TIFF,  JPEG,  GIF,  XPM.   a2ping delegates the low-level 
  work to Ghostscript (GS), pdftops and sam2p. a2ping fixes many  glitches  
  during the EPS to EPS conversion, so its output is often more compatible 
  and better embeddable than its input.
