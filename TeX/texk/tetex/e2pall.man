.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
\fBe2pall\fP searches through \fITEXFILE\fP for \eincludegraphics
commands to find the base names of image files\&.  When it finds one,
\fBe2pall\fP runs \fBepstopdf\fP(1) to create a PDF file from the EPS
file\&.
.PP 
\fBe2pall\fP will check to be sure that an existing PDF file is
up-to-date with the EPS file, and will not run \fBepstopdf\fP(1) if
the PDF file is newer than the EPS file\&.
