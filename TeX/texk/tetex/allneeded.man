.SH NAME
allneeded \- force the calculation of all fonts now needed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B allneeded [\-r] files ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I allneeded
forces the calculation of all fonts that are needed to preview a set of
dvi files. Just specify where the program should search for files on the
commandline.
The fonts generation is triggered by running
.IR dvips (1)
over all accessible dvi\-files. Therefore, the fonts are created in the resolution
needed by dvips.

If the \-r flag is specified, the command
.IR dvired (1)
will be used instead of dvips.

.I allneeded
does not recalculate existing fonts (as long as the Metafont mode does not change).
