.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dvibook
rearranges pages from a DVI file produced by TeX into ``signatures'' for
printing books or booklets, creating a new DVI file
usable by any of the TeX conversion programs.
.PP
The
.I \-s
option selects the size of signature which will be used. The signature size is
the number of sides which will be folded and bound together; the number given
should be a multiple of four. The default is to use one signature for the
whole file. Extra blank sides will be added if the file does not contain a
multiple of four pages.
.PP
Dvibook normally prints the page numbers of the pages rearranged; the
.I \-q
option suppresses this.

.SH BUGS
.I Dvibook
does not adjust the parameters in the postamble; however, since these
values are normally used only to size certain structures in the output
conversion programs, and the parameters never need to be adjusted upward,
this has not proven to be a problem.
