Correspondence between DTL and DVI files.
-----------------------------------------

DTL variety sequences-6, version 0.6.0
--------------------------------------

Note:  `DTL' stands for `Device-Independent Text Language', and is an
ASCII text representation of a DVI file.

DTL Commands
------------

    variety <variety-name>  Specifies name of DTL file type.

Naturally, `variety' has no DVI equivalent.

The other DTL commands correspond one-to-one with DVI commands, but I
have used briefer names (except for `special') than those used in the
DVI standards document.

    special  :  xxx (special commands with (1,2,3,4)-byte string length)
    fd  :  fnt_def (assign a number to a named font)
    pre  :  preamble
