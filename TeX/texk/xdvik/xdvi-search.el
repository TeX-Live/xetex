;;; (X)Emacs frontend to forward search with xdvi(k).
;;; Requires xdvi(k) >= 22.38.
;;;
;;; See http://xdvi.sourceforge.net/inverse-search.html and the section
;;; `FORWARD SEARCH' in the xdvi man page for more information on forward search.
;;;
;;; This file is available from: http://xdvi.sourceforge.net/xdvi-search.el
;;;
;;; $Revision: 1.34 $, tested with Emacs 20.4 to 21.2 and Xemacs 21.1 to 21.5

;;;
;;; Usage:
;;;
;;; - Add this file to some place where emacs can find it
;;;   (e.g. put it into a directory ~/emacs/, which you add to your
;;;   load path by putting the following line into your .emacs file:
;;;   
;;;      (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/"))
;;;   
;;;   Then, add the following line to your .emacs file:
;;;   
;;;      (require 'xdvi-search)
;;;   
;;;   After compiling your .tex file with source specials activated, you should
;;;   be able to use
;;;      M-x xdvi-jump-to-line
;;;   to make xdvi jump to the current location of the cursor.
;;;   
;;;   You could also bind this command to a key, e.g. by adding
;;;   a binding to tex-mode-hook:
;;;   
;;;      (add-hook 'tex-mode-hook (lambda ()
;;;                                 (local-set-key "\C-c\C-j" 'xdvi-jump-to-line)))
;;;
;;;   (without AucTeX; use LaTeX-mode-hook instead of tex-mode-hook with AucTeX.
;;;   Note that with AucTeX, C-c C-j is already bound to LaTeX-insert-item, so
;;;   you might want to use a different key combination instead.)
;;;
;;; - Note that with xdvik < 22.74.2, you may need to use one of the
;;;   functions xdvi-jump-to-line-fullpath() or xdvi-jump-to-line-relpath()
;;;   instead of xdvi-jump-to-line(), depending on the type of paths contained
;;;   in your \include{} commands. See the docstring of xdvi-jump-to-line()
;;;   for more information.
;;;
;;; Please send bug reports, improvements etc. to
;;; <stefanulrich@users.sourceforge.net>.

  "Call xdvi to perform a `forward search' for current file and line number.
Xdvi needs three pieces of information for this:

- the current line number
- the name of the current input file
- the name of the master .tex file.

The `master' .tex file (following AucTeX's terminology) is the same
as `\jobname' and determines the name of the DVI file.  It is either
obtained by using AucTeX's function `TeX-master-file' or, in case
AucTeX isn't available, by calling `xdvi-master-file-name', a function
which tries to mimick AucTeX's behaviour to obtain this filename.

For the current input file name, we need to rely on the DVI viewer to
make a smart matching of path suffixes with the file names that
actually occur in the specials, since specials inserted by TeX's
`-src' option may contain absolute or relative paths, depending on
whether TeX is called with a relative or absolute filename. (Similarly
for srcltx.sty, which can't expand paths.)

Note to users of older versions of xdvik (< 22.74.2), or non-k xdvi:

There are various ways of specifying an input file path for LaTeX's
\\input{} commands (which will end up in the source specials):

   (1) Filename only: \\input{chapter1}
   (2) Relative path name: \\input{chapters/chapter1}
   (3) Full path name: \\input{/home/user/tex/diss/chapters/chapter1}

Versions of xdvik < 22.74.2 and plain xdvi will not match pathname suffixes.
With these versions, `xdvi-jump-to-line' will only work with variant (1);
for (2) or (3) you will need to use one of `xdvi-jump-to-line-relpath' (for 2)
or `xdvi-jump-to-line-fullpath' (for 3) instead.
