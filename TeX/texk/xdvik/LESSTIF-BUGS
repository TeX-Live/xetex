Bugs of current xdvik with LessTif
==================================

This is a list of known bugs if current xdvik is compiled with
lesstif-0.93.18 (in decreasing severity).

Some of them may be bugs in xdvik, others bugs with LessTif. Currently
I don't have time and/or deeper knowledge of X to look into them.
People who want a working verion should use either OpenMotif, or
the Xaw version of xdvik instead. Ideas and tips are welcome ...

- Mouse-1 in Ruler mode and Text Selection mode is broken. Ruler doesn't
  jump to mouse position as it should, and the text selection isn't restarted.
  Instead, clicking Mouse-1 in text selection mode erases large parts of the
  drawing area.

  Somehow LessTif seems to intercept the mouse clicks, but this doesn't
  happen for the Magnifier. Maybe some bug in the Ruler/Text selection
  code? Current workaround: Warn if user toggles mouse mode with LessTif.

  Note: a similar thing happens with Motif 1.2.4:

- Page list: Toggling expert mode or the page list produces strange
  results when page list is switched on again: List appears too wide
  (hides part of horizontal scrollbar) and too short.

- Main window layout: window is too narrow when starting in expert
  mode (e.g. 80x900) and too wide (entire screen) in non-expert mode.
  Workaround: Use -geometry argument to force a sensible window size.

- Removing the scrollbars in expert mode doesn't work.

- Newline character `\n' in LabelGadget texts doesn't cause a line
  break. Workaround: Xdvi uses shorter labels when compiled with LessTif.

- Spinbox replacement in LessTif looks ugly. Workaround: Xdvi
  doesn't use Spinbox when compiled with LessTif.

- Preferences window: Headings list (left window) is a few pixels
  too small, cutoff of longest title. The list has a horizontal
  scrollbar even though it's not needed, and the part that is
  cut off can't be scrolled to.
