% Version 1.0 for xdvik-22.x and teTeX < 1.0 or non-teTeX installations,
% 2003/02/28
%
% Original version by Nicolai Langfeldt 2001/06/05

% NOTE TO TETEX USERS: For teTeX >= v1.0, use the file texmf/xdvi.cfg
% instead. That file uses ps2pk.map which will automatically be updated
% by teTeX's `updmap' script; by contrast, the map files listed in Section 2
% below need to be maintained manually.


% =============== Section 1: Encodings ===============
%
% Here we list all the encodings we want xdvi to recognize as an
% "implied" encoding.  This means that ptmr8r will be recognized as
% ptmr encoded with 8r and ptmr8y as ptmr encoded with 8y.  If the font file
% we want to encode with 8r is named ptmr8a, however, this must be listed in
% the map file entry.

% NOTE: the enc files used by xdvi are similar to those used by dvips,
% whith the important exception that xdvi _cannot_ parse postscript,
% so the vectors mustn't require postscript execution.

%	Suffix	Encoding name		Defined by this file
enc	8r	TeXBase1Encoding	8r.enc
enc	8c	CorkEncoding		cork.enc
enc	8y	TeXnANSIEncoding	texnansi.enc



% =============== Section 2: Map files ===============
%
% A font map file is a mapping of TeX font names (and encodings) to
% Postscript Type1 font names, similar to dvips' psfonts.map. See the
% dvips documentation for more information about the font map file
% format, and the file `README.t1fonts' in the xdvik source
% distribution for information on the differences between dvips and
% xdvik font maps.
%
% Multiple map files are allowed. If a font entry is found in several
% files, later entries will override earlier ones (and a warning
% will be printed to stderr). 
%
% The .map files listed below here are ones found in teTeX <= 1.0.

% xdvifont.map is a edited digest of psfonts.map for use with xdvi
dvipsmap xdvifont.map

% Users of teTeX-1.0 should use the following combination of map files:
%dvipsmap psfonts.map
%dvipsmap ps2pk.map

% Otherwise, you can add any of the following maps, depending on
% whether you have the respective fonts.

% We can use these un-modified:
dvipsmap marvosym.map
dvipsmap xypic.map

% If you applied t1mapper to the Charter fonts (they are in gs)
% you want this:
dvipsmap charter2.map
% otherwise you want this:
% dvipsmap charter.map

% Lucida fonts.  Possibly unsuitabe.  Much of these are wrong if
% t1mapper was applied to the fonts.  Some of the lines describing
% fonts with modified slant or width will need editing if t1mapper was
% applied.  If t1mapper was not applied they are both needed:
% dvipsmap lucidabr.map
% dvipsmap utopia.map

% "real" bakoma instead of interpolated bsr
% dvipsmap bakomaextra.map 
% this one *or* the previous one. Not both!
% dvipsmap bsr-missing-interpolated.map 

% Various symbol/calligraphic fonts
% dvipsmap hoekwater.map

% The following files are never needed: mathtime.map (partly trivial,
% partly unsuitable, the rest is in xdvifont.map); acrobat.map,
% lw35extra.map (t1mapper should have taken care of this); psfonts.map
% (see above); cs.map, omega.map, bsr.map (no map files needed for these).
