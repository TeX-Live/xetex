README for the texmf-alt (`alternative') directory:

This directory contains xdvi.cfg and *.map files for users of
older versions of teTeX (< 1.0) or non-teTeX distributions.

Users of teTeX >= 1.0 or TeXLive >= 6b should use the files
in ../texmf/ instead.

Installation:

The `make install' target doesn't install these files, so you'll
need to install them manually. Copy all files into the directory
	TEXMFMAIN/xdvi
where TEXMF is your main texmf tree. Use e.g.:

	kpsewhich --expand-path='$TEXMFMAIN'

to locate this directory. Make sure the XDVIINPUTS variable
(set either in the xdvi shell wrapper or in your shell)
contains this directory, e.g. by setting:

	export XDVIINPUTS='.;$TEXMF/{xdvi,dvips//}'

Some map files might also be located in the directory
TEXMFMAIN/dvips/config; setting XDVIINPUTS like above should
find these as well.

Please consult the file README.t1fonts if you experience problems
with your Type1 font setup.
