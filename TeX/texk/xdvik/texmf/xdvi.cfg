% original xdvi.cfg -- Configuration file for the Type1 rendering module of xdvi.
% (If you change or delete `original' in the first line of this file,
% new xdvik installations won't overwrite the file.)
%
% Lines starting with `%' are comments.
%
% This file is not suitable for teTeX versions before 1.0.  Users of
% such or non-teTeX installations should have a look at the following
% files instead:
%
% ../texmf-alt/xdvi.cfg
% ../README.t1fonts
%
% For using this file with teTeX-1.0.x, please uncomment the line with
% `psfonts.map' (preserving the order of the lines).
%
% For any later version of teTeX, no modification is needed.

% =============== Section 1: Encodings ===============
%
% Here we list all the encodings we want xdvi to recognize as an
% "implied" encoding. This means that a font named `ptmr8r' will
% be treated as font `ptmr' encoded with `8r', and `ptmr8y' as
% `ptmr' encoded with `8y'. Fonts that don not follow this convention
% must have an explicit encoding entry in the map file.
%
% The encoding files used by xdvi are similar to those used by dvips,
% whith the important exception that xdvi _cannot_ parse postscript,
% so the vectors mustn't require postscript execution.

%Keyword	Suffix	Encoding name		Defined by this file
enc		8r	TeXBase1Encoding	8r.enc
enc		8c	CorkEncoding		cork.enc
enc		8y	TeXnANSIEncoding	texnansi.enc



% =============== Section 2: Map files ===============
%
% A font map file is a mapping of TeX font names (and encodings) to
% Postscript Type1 font names, similar to dvips' psfonts.map. See the
% dvips documentation for more information about the font map file
% format, and the file `README.t1fonts' in the xdvik source
% distribution for information on the differences between dvips and
% xdvik font maps.
%
% Multiple map files are allowed. If a font entry is found in several
% files, later entries will override earlier ones (and a warning
% will be printed to stderr). 
%
% ps2pk has no "built-in" fonts, just like xdvik, so its map file is used
% for xdvik too. For teTeX-1.0, psfonts.map is needed in addition.

% dvipsmap psfonts.map
dvipsmap ps2pk.map
