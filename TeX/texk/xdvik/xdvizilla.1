.TH XDVIZILLA 1 "11 October 2002" "X Version 11"
.SH NAME
xdvizilla \- Helper application for running xdvi
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xdvizilla
[\fB\-no\-rm\fP]
.I file
.SH DESCRIPTION
Presently (October 2002), Mozilla has some bugs with helper applications:
it passes gzipped
.RB ( .gz )
files directly to the helper application without uncompressing, and it 
passes compressed
.RB ( .Z )
files as empty files.
.PP
To work around these problems,
.B xdvizilla
was written to look at files and decompress them correctly (depending on
their file types).
.PP
In addition, some sites produced tarred
.I dvi
files (including the
.I dvi
file as well as some included figures), and
.B xdvizilla
correctly handles those files as well.
.SH OPTIONS
Only one option is supported:
.TP
.B \-no\-rm
Normally
.B xdvizilla
will remove
.I file
before finishing.  This option inhibits this behavior.
.SH INSTALLATION
In addition to installing
.B xdvizilla
in a directory on the default search path, it is necessary to set it up
as a helper application within the browser.
.PP
For
.BR "Netscape 4.x" ,
add the following lines to the
.B mailcap
file:
.RS 5 
.nf
.ft 3
.sp 1n
application/x-dvi;      xdvi -safer %s
application/x-dvi-tar;  xdvizilla -no-rm %s
.sp 1n
.ft 
.fi
.RE 
.PP
For
.BR "Netscape 6.x" ,
.BR "Netscape 7.x" ,
or
.BR "Mozilla 1.x" ,
add the following lines to the
.B mailcap
file:
.RS 5 
.nf
.ft 3
.sp 1n
application/x-dvi;      xdvizilla %s
application/x-dvi-tar;  xdvizilla %s
.sp 1n
.ft 
.fi
.RE 
.PP
In addition, it would be useful to check that the following line is included
in the
.B mime.types
file:
.RS 5 
.nf
.ft 3
.sp 1n
type=application/x-dvi  exts="dvi"      desc="TeX dvi file"
.sp 1n
.ft
