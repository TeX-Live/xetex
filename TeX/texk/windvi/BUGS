This is a file of notes I made in my work with the k version of Xdvi.
The notes are intended as being usefull for myself as well as people
that try to compile xdvik on platforms where it has not been atempted
before.  Because the largest problem is the autoconf stuff.  I can't
seem to find good docs and I find the info manual confusing.

Please send bug-reports to janl@math.uio.no and include as much (relevant)
information as possible (such as platform, compiler, experiments carried
out to try to fix the problem and so forth).

xdvik-21.23 compiles and runs fine for me on HP-UX 10.20, Linux/Redhat
5.1 and Solaris 5.5.  That is not to say that all issues in the k port
of xdvi has been adressed, or even found.

Known features:
* Controll of font/file generation by X-resource and commandline is
  over-ridden by controll by environment variable/texmf.cnf setting.
  This is unfortunate but as far as I know unavoidable and thus a 
  feature rather than a bug.  If you want it to be resource/commandline
  controlled make sure there is no setting in the environment/texmf.cnf
* Under kpathsea the user cannot select MOTIF interface.  I'm not quite
  sure if it works correctly either, the k patch touch code at and around
  places where xdvi had #if MOTIF.
* Some k features such as HTEX/HAVE_LIBWWW is not practical to turn off.
  Changes in the autoconf setup must be acompanied by changes in
  mksedscript.  The HTEX features also appear to be rather fragile w.r.t.
  going back across documents/file/http borders.

configure.in:
- autoscan says we're missing these tests:
  AC_CHECK_HEADERS(sys/file.h sys/time.h)
  AC_CHECK_FUNCS(mkdir rmdir select)
  AC_PROG_GCC_TRADITIONAL
  On the other hand, their outcome would not be used.

c-auto.in:
- Not sure if there are tests for all the things mentioned in this file.
  Not sure how to find out.
- There is no AC_ARG_WITH in configure.in to activate MOTIF.  There is
  a macro in Pauls configure.in for this but there is another, incompatible
  from kpathsea for toolkit selection.  Kpathsea code used on unclear
  grouds.
- Not sure that there is a actual test for wether the user wants
  MKTEXPK/MAKETEXPK anywhere?
- GS_PATH cannot be set except by CFLAGS=-DGS_PATH=...
  Paul has a macro for this.  Must be compatible with kpathsea, but
  I haven't checked this yet.

config.hin:
- This file is not used in the k port. c-auto.in is kpathsea style...
- A lot of the symbols from this was moved to c-auto.in, those _not_ moved
  are left in the file as a reference.  I suspect they should be moved
  but found them confusing
