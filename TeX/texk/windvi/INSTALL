THIS IS ALPHA QUALITY SOFTWARE!

Did you read the README file?

How to install:
1. ./configure --prefix=/texmf-prefix
2. make
3a. If you dare (I wouldn't): make install
3b. If you don't: 
    cp texk/xdvik/xdvi.bin libs/t1lib/type1afm/type1afm /path/for/bin
4. cp texk/xdvik/texmf/* /usr/local/texmf/share/lib/xdvi
   That might not be the right path for you though (
   /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf/xdvi is another likely path).
   See point 5.
   PLEASE NOTE that these enc files are different from the ones used
   by dvips so they should not be in dvips' way.   Please review xdvi.cfg
   to see what font maps are appropriate for you.  Update the texk
   file database (teTeX users run 'texhash').
5. Ensure that you have a XDVIINPUTS variable in your texmf.cnf or
   environment which names the directory you installed the above files
   in so xdvi can find them.
6. Read XDVIFONTS to install type1 fonts for xdvi.  Probably not needed
   in a recent teTeX installation.

Here is the normal INSTALL file:
-------------

Installing xdvik is essentially the same as installing any other
Kpathsea-using program.  Therefore, for the basic steps involved, the
file `kpathsea/INSTALL'.

For common problems and information on how to report a bug, see
`kpathsea/BUGS'.

xdvi-specific items and a terse summary of the steps:

0.1. If you want the hypertext support (recognition of url specials and
clicking on links), install the W3C reference library and header files
if necessary: http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/w3c-libwww.tar.gz.  The
.h files must be visible to the compiler, so you may have to set the
environment variable CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/wwwherever.  (You may
also be interested in the Java previewer IDVI, available at
@url{http://www.win.tue.nl/~dickie/idvi}.)

0.2. If you have Aladdin Ghostscript 4.0 or 4.01, get 4.02.  Otherwise,
xdvi will not be able to run gs to show included eps files.  (You can
fix this bug by adding a line
  .clearerror
before the `% Close up systemdict.' comment.)

1. Run `configure' (in the top-level directory, the one with
subdirectories `kpathsea' and `xdvi').  This guesses system
dependencies.  configure --help lists all available options.  See
../kpathsea/CONFIGURE for options to the configure script; also run
configure --help.

By default, Ghostscript is used to render PostScript specials.
To disable this, specify `--without-ps' to configure.
To use Display PostScript instead of gs, specify `--with-ps=dps'.
To use NeWS instead of gs, specify `--with-ps=news'.
(Naturally you must have the dps and news libraries for these to work!)
You can specify more than one --with-ps option if desired; then Ghostscript
  is used last.

To use only Xlib routines, specify `--with-x-toolkit=no' to configure.
Functionality is necessarily reduced.  If you are using an HP, IBM, or
other system that does not include the Xaw library by default, consider
installing the freely available X11 distribution, available from
ftp://ftp.x.org and mirrors.

2. If necessary, change the default paths or other definitions.
See kpathsea/INSTALL for details.

Things you might want to add to the DEFS or CFLAGS or XCFLAGS Make variables:
-DA4 to get A4 size windows by default.
-DALTFONT=\"myfont\" to change the fallback font from cmr10.
-DBDPI=num to change default resolution to num from 600.
-DMFMODE=\"mode\" to set the default mode.
-DSHRINK=\"num\" to change the default shrink factor (yes, a string) from 6.
-DNOBUTTONS to disable radio buttons for common commands.
-DNOGREY to disable using grayscale to display shrunken bitmaps 
   (which also works on monochrome monitors).
-DNOQUERY if you have trouble compiling drawingWidgetClass?
-DNOSELFILE to disable SelFile widget support.
-DNOTEXXET to disable DVI opcodes 250 and 251.
   
The following can be set according to what xdvi's CONTROL-P command
reports for `bitord' and `Unit' for your most common display:
     bitord = 1  =>  -DMSBITFIRST
     Unit = 32   =>  -DBMLONG
     Unit = 16   =>  -DBMSHORT
If this makes any substantial performance difference in your
environment, please let me know.

3. `make'.

4. `make install' (by default, files will be installed under /usr/local).
(Or `make install-exec', to install just the executables,
or `make install-data', to install just the architecture-independent files.)

5. `make distclean' (or `mostlyclean', or `clean', or `realclean',
depending on how clean you want to be).

If you wish to preview documents using PostScript fonts, you may find
ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/psfonts.tar.gz (Ghostscript-generated bitmaps for
the standard 35 PS fonts at multiples of 600dpi) useful. The gsftopk
program that comes with xdvik can generate such bitmaps on the fly; the
distributed MakeTeXPK attempts to do this.

If problems:

* See kpathsea/INSTALL for common system-dependent problems.

* If you run out of file descriptors (``Too many open files''),
typically when MakeTeXPK is invoked, you may need to recompile the
kernel on your system (e.g., SunOS).  Alternatively, the ulimit command
might allow you to increase this limit (e.g., Solaris).  xdvi tries to
close files as necessary to avoid this, but if you use lots of fonts on
one page, it's unavoidable.

* SCO: download libXaw from sosco.sco.com:/TLS/tls005.tar.Z.

* Tadpole Sparcbook: Comes with obsolete X11 libraries in
  /usr/openwin/lib. You must install more recent libraries.
