Xdvik with t1 fonts.

With this I announce the availability of xdvik-22.06-t1-beta1.  The
last public release was xdvik-22.06-t1-alpha4.  Due to the excelent
work done by Paul Vojta in xdvi and Rainer Menzner in t1lib this has
been a lot easier than it could have been.

The t1 functionality will eventualy be part of xdvik, so test now or
tear your hair later ;-)

xdvik-t1-beta1 has these features:
- Based on t1lib 0.9
- Faster startup than alpha4 due to defered t1 font loading.  But t1
  font loading still has quite high overhead compared to pk font
  loading.  Keep your xdvi going, don't quit it each time.
- Correct glyph sizes for scaled fonts (e.g., cmr10 at 17pt and so on)
- Better accomodation for asian languages.
- dvips compatible w.r.t. fontmaps, but some changes in your maps to
  accomodate xdvi might still be needed.
- automatic encoding recognition heuristic, minimizing the fontmaps needed
  in most cases.  No fontmaps needed for cmr10 and the other type1 cm and
  ams fonts, or indeed, most other TeX fonts.
- helper program to steal fonts from ghostscript to use as Times-Roman
  and all the other usual Postscript fonts.  Some of these will require
  fontmaps though.
- helper function to use your commercial postscript fonts.  Some of these
  will also require fontmaps - you can probably use your existing maps.

Please read the documents, in particular the README and XDVIFONTS
files, there are new things in these for everyone.  It should be quite
easy to install in a recent teTeX installation though.

I want comments, remarks and patches, even for the smallest nit, xdvi
is quite important to the Unix TeX community, so help me help you.
Please send it to janl@linpro.no.  Due to time restraints it might be
a while before I'm able to answer or adress the problems raised
though.

xdvik-t1 is available from http://www.math.uio.no/~janl/xdvi/t1/,
ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/ and, after a mirroring delay, on CTAN.
