% This file describes the encodings xdvi is to recognize as implied.
encmap encoding.map

% psfonts.map for dvips is _not_ useable with xdvi.
% dvipsmap psfonts.map
%
% xdvifont.map is a edited digest of psfonts.map for use with xdvi
dvipsmap xdvifont.map

% We can use these un-modified:
dvipsmap marvosym.map
dvipsmap xypic.map

% If you applied t1mapper to the Charter fonts (they are in gs)
% you want this:
dvipsmap charter2.map
% otherwise you want this:
% dvipsmap charter.map

% These are trivial, and thus not needed.
% dvipsmap cs.map
% dvipsmap omega.map
% dvipsmap bsr.map

% Unsuitable. t1mapper -gs took care of this
% dvipsmap acrobat.map
% dvipsmap lw35extra.map

% Lucida fonts.  Possebly unsuitabe.  Much of these are wrong if
% t1mapper was applied to the fonts.  Some of the lines describing
% fonts with modified slant or width will need editing if t1mapper was
% applied.  If t1mapper was not applied they are both needed:
% dvipsmap lucidabr.map
% dvipsmap utopia.map

% Partly trivial, partly unsuitable, the rest in xdvifont.map:
% dvipsmap mathtime.map

% "real" bakoma instead of interpolated bsr
% dvipsmap bakomaextra.map 
% this one *or* the previous one. Not both!
% dvipsmap bsr-missing-interpolated.map 

% What is this?
% dvipsmap hoekwater.map
