% Here we enumerate all the encodings we want xdvi to recognize as 
% an "implied" encoding.  Which means that ptmr8r will be recognized as
% ptmr 8r encoded and ptmr8y is ptmr encoded with 8y.  If the font file
% we want to 8r encode is named ptmr8a then we need a map file entry.

% NOTE: the enc files used by xdvi are special.  They are NOT identical
% to the enc files used by dvips.

% This file could easily be used by any other tex program that wants
% to handle implied encodings.
