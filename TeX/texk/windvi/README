THIS IS BETA QUALITY SOFTWARE!

XDVI-K-T1 prescript:

- Please see INSTALL for installation instructions.  And please note that
  by default this xdvi will be installed on top of your old xdvi, so you
  might want to install it by hand with another name.
- Please see XDVIFONTS for instructiont on font installation
- Please send bug reports to janl@linpro.no.  If you don't have
  a fix please make a minimal (La)TeX file for reporoducing the
  problem available for me by e-mail, ftp or http.
- Xdvik-t1 will be maintained separately from xdvik until the t1
  extentions are robust and complete enough for general use.
  At that point they will be merged with regular xdvik.

Features:
- Internal rendering of type1 fonts.  Fast.
- There is something broken with painting type1 glyphs when anti-aliasing
  is active.  On 8 bit displays -install helps. I don't know what's wrong,
  I'm not X11 programmer.  If you are, please look into it ;-)
- A bit slow on remote X displays, even slower over ssh.  There is a
  performance problem compared to pk files somewhere in the painting
  routines. 

The font search order is now:
1. Virtual fonts
2. Type1 fonts
3. PK fonts
4. GF fonts if xdvik was compiled with gf support.

In most texk/teTeX installations cmr10.pfb is present in the texmf
tree.  This means that it is found at step 2 in the search and the t1
font is used.  To make xdvi use type1 versions of other ps fonts
please see the XDVIFONTS file.  Currently xdvik handles fonts with no
implied coding (such as cmr10). Please see the xdvifont.map file for
further insight.

XDVI-K prescript:

This is the kpathsea version of xdvi, called xdvik.

xdvik is maintained by me, Nicolai Langfeldt, (janl@math.uio.no)

The k extentions for xdvi was written by many people, whose names
are sprinkled in the source files.  

Se `../kpathsea/BUGS' for details on reporting bugs. Please send any
bug reports to janl@math.uio.no, not to Paul and not to any kpathsea
list. Also please check the file BUGS in this directory for
information about issues that have been unclear to me during the work
on this, it might provide hints if you discover a problem.

The K version differs from the original in that it uses the same code
for path searching as the other web2c software and incorporates some
features desired inside the web2c project (grid on the magnifier,
``hypertex'' and ``selfile'' at least).

xdvik is free software: Paul's original files are a variant of the BSD
license; some kpathsea files are covered by the GNU General Public
License -- see the files COPYING*.

xdvik is available from CPAN in the systems/unix/web2c directories as
well as http://www.math.uio.no/~janl/xdvi/

k-modification history:
* 21.21:
  - xdvik 21.21 is produced from xdvik 20c and xdvi-21.21.  Two whole
    days of work to get the merge sane.
* Various versions: A lot of fixes to the port of k features to xdvi-21
  contributed by self and tex-k/tex-pretest readers as well as Thomas
  Esser of teTeX.  Some potential problems are mentioned in the BUGS
  file of the xdvik 21 distribution. 
* 21.29b:
  - Selfile fix from Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de> helps the CANCEL
    button to work.
  - mime.c patch from Allin Cottrell <cottrell@ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu>
    makes hypertex browsing more reliable
  - xdvik always assumed that #foo is a URL fragment reference and
    removed it unconditionaly.  Emacs uses # as temporary file
    prefix (and infix) and so emacs' TeX mode produced tex and thus
    dvi files with # in the name.  Problem found by many and solutions
    suggested by many.  Only remove #foo if the dvi name _is_ an url.

xdvi changelog is at the end of this file.

DESCRIPTION

xdvi is a program for previewing .dvi files, which are produced by the
mathematical typesetting system, TeX.

Installation instructions are in the file INSTALL.

At the present time, the person to send bug reports to is Paul Vojta,
	vojta@math.berkeley.edu.
When doing so, please specify hardware and OS version, options used
when running the ./configure script, and anything else that may be
relevant.  Be sure you've checked the FAQ first, especially for questions
regarding searching for font files.

Current information on xdvi is also available on the WWW at the URL
http://math.berkeley.edu/~vojta/xdvi.html

This software has been tested on Sparc (SunOS 4.1.4 and 5.5.1) and Intel 486
(Linux 1.2.11).

Current versions of this program can be obtained via anonymous ftp from
the following location:
	ftp.x.org		file contrib/applications/xdvi-22.tar.gz
	[198.112.44.100]
To ease the load on ftp.x.org, you may also check other X archives, for example:
	gatekeeper.dec.com	file pub/X11/contrib/applications/xdvi-22.tar.gz
	[16.1.0.2]
More recent versions of xdvi are often available at:
	math.berkeley.edu	pub/Software/TeX/xdvi-latest.tar.gz
	[128.32.183.94]
	math.berkeley.edu	pub/Software/TeX/xdvi-beta.tar.gz
	[128.32.183.94]
The xdvi-beta version, if present, is more recent but may have more bugs.

================================================================

Notes of a historical nature follow.  Most recent changes are listed at the end
of the file.

================================================================

This directory contains a version of xdvi capable of reading GF, PXL
and PK font files. This version of xdvi is based on the source that
"came with" X v10r3. Xdvi was modified by Paal Kvamme at the Norwegian
Institute of Technology, based on the modifications I had made to
dviimp (a dvi to ImPress converter). This code was again more or less
directly translated from the web source of PKtoPX.

If you discover (and fix) any bugs in this code, please notify me, so
I can make the corresponding changes myself.

================================================================
*MORE* fixes (for athena release locker) [eichin:19880722.2058EST]
Fixes:
	narrow vertical and horizontal lines no longer disappear.
	bogus underlining (which usually occured on even sample sizes
of odd sized characters) no longer occurs.
	-S number (or typing number followed by S) will adjust the
sampling fraction; 0 is special cased to mean if anything in the
sampled zone is set, set the sample, else clear it. Interesting to
experiment with, though not useful for reading (the default value of 3
is just right.)
	-display and -geometry arguments work (so do old style forms,
though they were broken before)
	fixed one of the PK debugging messages to print the correct
font name instead of printing the pointer as text.
	included Ken Raeburn <raeburn>'s changes to support multiple
screens.
================================================================
More changes:

    1.	Incorporated the bitmap under a viewport widget using the toolkit
	(X11 only);
    2.	Added an icon and icon geometry arguments (X11 only);
    3.	Supported window resizing;
    4.	Added a 'c' option to move whatever is currently under the cursor to
	the center of the window;
    5.	Added an 'R' option to reread the .dvi file, and added logic to make
	'R' happen automatically whenever any part of the window is exposed
	and the dvi file changes (so that you can iconify xdvi, run tex,
	deiconify xdvi, and voila!);
    6.	Added a 'magnifying glass':  when you push a button, a window pops
	up, showing the region of the page, unshrunk;
    7.	Added support for gf fonts;
    8.	Upgraded font searching (at our site we use /usr/custom/tex82/gf
	for gf fonts, /usr/custom/tex82/pk for pk fonts, etc.);
    9.	Made numerous internal changes (removed all the lint I could,
	made unshrunk bitmaps permanently resident, which speeds up size
	changing, made table.h necessary only for pxl.h, split up the source
	file into xdvi.c, dvi.c, gf.c, pxl.c, and pk.c, made shrinking occur
	relative to the character's hot point, etc.)
   10.	The program reads SIGIO signals and processes incoming events
	immediately, so that it can stop displaying things that would be
	erased anyway.  If these interrupts are not coming through, then
	it also checks for incoming events every several dozen characters
	displayed.
   11.	Further split up dvi.c into dvi_init.c and dvi_draw.c; added
	compilation options for various internal bitmap representations.
	Fixed it so gcc won't give warnings, and so it works with R3 toolkit.
--  Patchlevel 2:  --
   12.	Added MAXCHARS compilation option.  Eliminated the nonsense with
	generating table.h.
--  Patchlevel 3:  --
   13.	Added -altfont command line option and SYSV compilation option.
   14.	Modified for System V boxes:  -DSYSV compiler option.  Modifications
	by Donald Richardson, donr@crystal.mie.clarkson.edu
--  Patchlevel 4:  --
   15.	Removed MAXCHARS compilation option.  It's automatic now.  Made X10
	scrolling smoother.  Implemented the moving magnifying glass.
--  Patchlevel 5:  --
   16.	Implemented compilation without the toolkit, as well as scrollbars
	and tpic support in X10.  Also this version should work with color
	VAXstations, although overstrike characters will come out incorrectly.
   17.	Fixed a bug in gf reading routines:  specials at the beginning of
	a character def. were not being processed.  Thanks to
	kevin@amath.washington.edu for a bug report and fix.
   18.	Added 'k' keystroke.
--  Patchlevel 6:  --
   19.	Added buttons on the right side of the window.
   20.	Added -pagewidth and -pageheight command line options and A4
	compilation option.
   21.	Added a yet more robust font finding algorithm.
--  Patchlevel 7:  --
   22.	Replaced -pagewidth and -pageheight options with -paper.
--  Patchlevel 8:  --
   23.	Added compatibility for X11R4 and VMS.  Fixed up alignment of rules.
--  Patchlevel 9:  --
   24.	Removed obsolete '#' and '=' options from the X11 version:  they
	interfere with emacs.
--  Patchlevel 10: --
   25.	Implemented arrow keys, expert mode, searching for the font's actual
	size first, the -[xy]offset and -sw options, and numerous bug fixes.
--  Patchlevel 11: --
   26.	Implemented recursive searching for font files in subdirectories.
   27.	Changed +sw to -hushspecials and implemented -hush.
   28.	Modified mksedscript so that the man page comes out neater.
   29.	Added a -keep option and resource to match the `k' keystroke.
--  Patchlevel 12: --
   30.	Implemented virtual fonts (this does not include built-in
	Postscript<tm> fonts!!!).
   31.	X11R5 support, and numerous bug fixes.
--  Patchlevel 13: --
   32.	Added support for TeXXeT.
--  Patchlevel 14: --
   33.	Added support for greyscale anti-aliasing.
--  Patchlevel 15: --
   34.	Added support for MakeTeXPK, as in dvips.
--  Patchlevel 16: --
   35.	In the code for greyscale anti-aliasing, try to allocate a colormap
	so that GXor operations can be used for drawing.  Also interpolate
	between foreground and background colors.
--  Patchlevel 17: --
   36.	Fixed some bugs in the greyscale code.
   37.	Implemented an environment variable for the MakeTeXPK script.
   38.	Replaced mksedscript with a script using /bin/sh.
--  Patchlevel 18: --
   39.	Implemented checking of checksums and the -hushchecksums option.
   40.	Implemented non-square magnifying glasses.
   41.	Removed support for X10.
   42.	Removed support for the pxl font format.
   43.	Added support for PostScript specials via DPS or NeWS or gs.
--  Patchlevel 19: --
   44.	Implemented `header=' and `!' PostScript specials (and the
	corresponding -noscan option).
   45.	Implemented path searching for PostScript header and figure files,
	in addition to shell escape capability (also the -allowshell option).
   46.	Allow setting of -gamma with the `S' keystroke.
   47.	Added options -nomakepk, -mfmode, -safer, -interpreter, -nogssafer, and
	-gspalette.
--  Patchlevel 20: --
   48.	Bug fixes.
--  Patchlevel 21: --
   49.	Receipt of a SIGUSR1 signal causes xdvi to reread the dvi file.
   50.	Support for the TeX Directory Structure standard, ls-R quick-find,
	and configuration files.
   51.	Fix greyscale code to work with TrueColor visual.  Thanks to Lee
	Hetherington for this one.
-- Version 22: --
   52.	Handle rotated bounding boxes correctly when not showing PostScript.
	(Based on a patch by H. Zeller.)
   53.	The "-s 0" command line option.
   54.	Support for Motif.
   55.	Support for displays with more than one visual, and the -noinstall
	command line option.

	magsteps.
   60.	Change -hushspecials to -warnspecials, and suppress warnings about
	undefined specials by default.
   61.	Add -gsalpha option.
-- Added since last major release:
   62.	Add 'V' keystroke to toggle -gsalpha argument (based on a patch by
	fred@thp.Uni-Duisburg.DE).
