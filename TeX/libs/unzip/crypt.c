   This is a non-functional version of Info-ZIP's crypt.c encryption/
   decryption code for Zip, ZipCloak, UnZip and fUnZip.  This file is
   not copyrighted and may be distributed freely. :-)  See the "WHERE"
   file for sites from which to obtain the full encryption/decryption
   sources (zcrypt28.zip or later).
