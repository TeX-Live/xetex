EXAMPLES

This directory is for tiny libcurl programming examples. They are meant to
show some simple steps on how you can build your own application to take full
advantage of libcurl.

If you end up with other small but still useful example sources, please mail
them for submission in future packages and on the web site.

The Makefile.example is an example makefile that could be used to build these
examples. Just edit the file according to your system and requirements first.

Most examples should build fine using a command line like this:

  $ gcc `curl-config --cflags` `curl-config --libs` -o example example.c

Try the php/examples/ directory for PHP programming snippets!

  *PLEASE* do not use the curl.haxx.se site as a test target for your libcurl
  applications/experiments. Even if the examples in this directory use that
  site as an example URL at some places, it doesn't mean that the URLs work or
  that we expect you to actually torture our web site with your tests! Thanks.
