</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>curl-config</B> <B>[options]</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>curl-config</B>  displays  information about a previous curl and
     libcurl installation.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     --cc Displays the compiler used to build libcurl.

     --cflags
          Set of compiler options (CFLAGS) to use when  compiling
          files  that  use  libcurl.  Currently  that is only thw
          include path to the curl include files.

     --feature
          Lists  what  particular  main  features  the  installed
          libcurl  was  built  with. At the time of writing, this
          list may include SSL, KRB4 or IPv6. Do not  assume  any
          particular  order.  The  keywords  will be separated by
          newlines. There may be none, one or several keywords in
          the list.

     --help
          Displays the available options.

     --libs
          Shows the complete set of libs and other linker options
          you will need in order to link  your  application  with
          libcurl.

     --prefix
          This  is  the  prefix  used when libcurl was installed.
          Libcurl is then installed in $prefix/lib and its header
          files  are  installed in $prefix/include and so on. The
          prefix is set with "configure --prefix".

     --version
          Outputs  version  information   about   the   installed
          libcurl.

     --vernum
          Outputs   version   information   about  the  installed
          libcurl, in numerical mode.  This outputs  the  version
          number,  in  hexadecimal,  with  8  bits for each part;
          major, minor, patch. So that libcurl 7.7.4 would appear
          as   070704   and  libcurl  12.13.14  would  appear  as
          0c0d0e...
