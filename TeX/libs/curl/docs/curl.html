     curl - transfer a URL


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>curl</B> <B>[options]</B> <I>[URL...]</I>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>curl</B>  is  a client to get documents/files from or send docu­
     ments to a server, using  any  of  the  supported  protocols
     (HTTP,  HTTPS, FTP, GOPHER, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). The
     command is designed to work without user interaction or  any
     kind of interactivity.

     curl  offers  a busload of useful tricks like proxy support,
     user authentication, ftp upload,  HTTP  post,  SSL  (https:)
     connections, cookies, file transfer resume and more.


</PRE>
<H2>URL</H2><PRE>
     The URL syntax is protocol dependent. You'll find a detailed
     description in RFC 2396.

     You can specify multiple URLs or parts of  URLs  by  writing
     part sets within braces as in:

      http://site.{one,two,three}.com

     or  you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using []
     as in:

      ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt
      ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading
     zeros)
      ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt

     It  is possible to specify up to 9 sets or series for a URL,
     but no nesting is supported at the moment:

      http://www.any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol­
     ume[1-4]part{a,b,c,index}.html

     You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They
     will be fetched in a  sequential  manner  in  the  specified
     order.

     Curl  will  attempt  to re-use connections for multiple file
     transfers, so that getting many files from the  same  server
     will  not  do  multiple connects / handshakes. This improves
     speed. Of course this is only done on files specified  on  a
     single command line and cannot be used between separate curl
     invokes.



</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     -a/--append
          (FTP) When used in a ftp upload, this will tell curl to
          append to the target file instead of overwriting it. If
          the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

          If this option is used twice, the second one will  dis­
          able append mode again.

     -A/--user-agent &lt;agent string&gt;
          (HTTP)  Specify  the  User-Agent  string to send to the
          HTTP server. Some badly done CGIs fail if its  not  set
          to "Mozilla/4.0".  To encode blanks in the string, sur­
          round the string with single  quote  marks.   This  can
          also be set with the -H/--header flag of course.

          If this option is set more than once, the last one will
          be the one that's used.

     -b/--cookie &lt;name=data&gt;
          (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It
          is  supposedly  the  data  previously received from the
          server in a "Set-Cookie:" line.  The data should be  in
          the format "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2".

          If  no '=' letter is used in the line, it is treated as
          a filename to use  to  read  previously  stored  cookie
          lines  from,  which  should  be used in this session if
          they  match.  Using  this  method  also  activates  the
          "cookie  parser"  which  will make curl record incoming
          cookies too, which may be handy if you're using this in
          combination  with  the  -L/--location  option. The file
          format of the file to read cookies from should be plain
          HTTP  headers  or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file for­
          mat.

          <B>NOTE</B> that the file specified with -b/--cookie  is  only
          used  as  input. No cookies will be stored in the file.
          To store cookies, save the HTTP headers to a file using
          -D/--dump-header!

          If this option is set more than once, the last one will
          be the one that's used.

     -B/--use-ascii
          Use ASCII transfer when getting an  FTP  file  or  LDAP
          info.  For  FTP,  this can also be enforced by using an
          URL that ends with ";type=A". This option  causes  data
          sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.

          If  this option is used twice, the second one will dis­
          able ASCII usage.

     --ciphers &lt;list of ciphers&gt;
          (SSL) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection.
          The  list  of ciphers must be using valid ciphers. Read
          up  on  SSL  cipher   list   details   on   this   URL:
          <I>http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</I>   <I>(Option</I>
          <I>added</I> <I>in</I> <I>curl</I> <I>7.9)</I>

          If this option is used severl times, the last one  will
          override the others.

     --connect-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
          Maximum  time  in seconds that you allow the connection
          to the server to take.  This only limits the connection
          phase,  once  curl  has  connected this option is of no
          more use. This option  didn't  work  in  win32  systems
          until 7.7.2.  See also the <I>--max-time</I> option.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -c/--cookie-jar &lt;file name&gt;
          Specify to which file you want curl to write all  cook­
          ies  after a completed operation. Curl writes all cook­
          ies previously read from a specified file  as  well  as
          all cookies received from remote server(s). If no cook­
          ies are known, no file will be written. The  file  will
          be  written  using  the Netscape cookie file format. If
          you set the file name to a single dash, "-", the  cook­
          ies  will  be  written to stdout. (Option added in curl
          7.9)

          If this option is used several times, the last specfied
          file name will be used.

     -C/--continue-at &lt;offset&gt;
          Continue/Resume  a  previous file transfer at the given
          offset. The given offset is the exact number  of  bytes
          that  will be skipped counted from the beginning of the
          source file before it is transfered to the destination.
          If  used with uploads, the ftp server command SIZE will
          not be used by curl.

          Use "-C -" to  tell  curl  to  automatically  find  out
          where/how  to  resume  the  transfer.  It then uses the
          given output/input files to figure that out.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -d/--data &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP)  Sends  the  specified data in a POST request to
          the HTTP server, in a way that can emulate as if a user
          has  filled  in a HTML form and pressed the submit but­
          ton. Note that the data is sent  exactly  as  specified
          with  no  extra processing (with all newlines cut off).
          The data is expected to  be  "url-encoded".  This  will
          cause  curl  to  pass  the data to the server using the
          content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare
          to -F. If more than one -d/--data option is used on the
          same command line, the data pieces  specified  will  be
          merged together with a separating &amp;-letter. Thus, using
          '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy' would generate  a  post
          chunk that looks like 'name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy'.

          If  you  start  the  data  with  the letter @, the rest
          should be a file name to read the data from,  or  -  if
          you  want  curl  to read the data from stdin.  The con­
          tents of the file must already be url-encoded. Multiple
          files  can  also be specified. Posting data from a file
          named 'foobar' would thus be done  with  "--data  @foo­
          bar".

          To  post data purely binary, you should instead use the
          --data-binary option.

          -d/--data is the same as --data-ascii.

          If this option is used several times, the ones  follow­
          ing the first will append data.

     --data-ascii &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP) This is an alias for the -d/--data option.

          If  this option is used several times, the ones follow­
          ing the first will append data.

     --data-binary &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP) This posts data in a similar manner  as  --data-
          ascii  does, although when using this option the entire
          context of the posted data is kept as-is. If  you  want
          to  post  a binary file without the strip-newlines fea­
          ture of the --data-ascii option, this is for you.

          If this option is used several times, the ones  follow­
          ing the first will append data.

     --disable-epsv
          (FTP)  Tell curl to disable the use of the EPSV command
          when doing passive FTP downloads.  Curl  will  normally
          always  first attempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with
          this option, it will not try using EPSV.

          IF this option is used several times,  each  occurrence
          will toggle this on/off.

     -D/--dump-header &lt;file&gt;
          (HTTP/FTP)  Write  the HTTP headers to this file. Write
          the FTP file info to this file if -I/--head is used.

          This option is handy to use when you want to store  the
          cookies  that  a  HTTP  site  sends to you. The cookies
          could then be read in a second curl invoke by using the
          -b/--cookie option!

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -e/--referer &lt;URL&gt;
          (HTTP) Sends the "Referer Page" information to the HTTP
          server.  This can also be set with the -H/--header flag
          of course.  When used with <I>-L/--location</I> you can append
          ";auto"  to  the referer URL to make curl automatically
          set the  previous  URL  when  it  follows  a  Location:
          header.  The  ";auto" string can be used alone, even if
          you don't set an initial referer.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     --egd-file &lt;file&gt;
          (HTTPS)  Specify the path name to the Entropy Gathering
          Daemon socket. The socket is used to  seed  the  random
          engine  for SSL connections. See also the <I>--random-file</I>
          option.

     -E/--cert &lt;certificate[:password]&gt;
          (HTTPS) Tells curl to  use  the  specified  certificate
          file  when  getting  a file with HTTPS. The certificate
          must be in PEM format.  If the optional password  isn't
          specified, it will be queried for on the terminal. Note
          that this certificate is the private key and  the  pri­
          vate certificate concatenated!

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     --cacert &lt;CA certificate&gt;
          (HTTPS) Tells curl to  use  the  specified  certificate
          file to verify the peer. The certificate must be in PEM
          format.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -f/--fail
          (HTTP)  Fail  silently  (no  output  at  all) on server
          errors. This is mostly done like this to better  enable
          scripts  etc  to  better  deal with failed attempts. In
          normal cases when a HTTP server fails to deliver a doc­
          ument,  it  returns  a  HTML document stating so (which
          often also describes why and more). This flag will pre­
          vent  curl  from  outputting  that  and  fail  silently
          instead.

          If this option is used twice,  the  second  will  again
          disable silent failure.

     -F/--form &lt;name=content&gt;
          (HTTP) This lets curl emulate a filled in form in which
          a user has pressed the submit button. This causes  curl
          to POST data using the content-type multipart/form-data
          according to RFC1867. This enables uploading of  binary
          files etc. To force the 'content' part to be be a file,
          prefix the file name with an @ sign. To  just  get  the
          content part from a file, prefix the file name with the
          letter &lt;. The difference between @ and &lt; is then that @
          makes a file get attached in the post as a file upload,
          while the &lt; makes a text field and just  get  the  con­
          tents for that text field from a file.

          Example,  to  send  your  password  file to the server,
          where 'password' is the name of the form-field to which
          /etc/passwd will be the input:

          <B>curl</B> -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com

          To read the file's content from stdin insted of a file,
          use - where the file name should've been. This goes for
          both @ and &lt; constructs.

          This option can be used multiple times.

     -g/--globoff
          This  option  switches  off  the "URL globbing parser".
          When you set this option, you  can  specify  URLs  that
          contain  the  letters  {}[]  without  having them being
          interpreted by curl itself. Note that these letters are
          not  normal  legal  URL  contents  but  they  should be
          encoded according to the URI standard. (Option added in
          curl 7.6)

     -G/--get
          When  used,  this  option  will make all data specified
          with -d/--data or --data-binary to be used  in  a  HTTP
          GET  request instead of the POST request that otherwise
          would be used. The data will be  appended  to  the  URL
          with a '?'  separator. (Option added in curl 7.9)

     -h/--help
          Usage help.

     -H/--header &lt;header&gt;
          (HTTP) Extra header to use when getting a web page. You
          may specify any number of extra headers. Note  that  if
          you  should  add a custom header that has the same name
          as one of the internal ones curl would use, your exter­
          nally  set  header will be used instead of the internal
          one. This allows you to make even trickier  stuff  than
          curl  would  normally do. You should not replace inter­
          nally set headers without knowing perfectly  well  what
          you're  doing.  Replacing  an  internal header with one
          without content on the right side  of  the  colon  will
          prevent that header from appearing.

          This option can be used multiple times.

     -i/--include
          (HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the output. The HTTP-
          header includes things like server-name,  date  of  the
          document, HTTP-version and more...

          If  this  option  is  used twice, the second will again
          disable header include.

     --interface &lt;name&gt;
          Perform an operation using a specified  interface.  You
          can  enter  interface name, IP address or host name. An
          example could look like:

          <B>curl</B> <B>--interface</B> <B>eth0:1</B> <B>http://www.netscape.com/</B>

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -I/--head
          (HTTP/FTP)  Fetch  the  HTTP-header  only! HTTP-servers
          feature the command HEAD which this uses to get nothing
          but  the header of a document. When used on a FTP file,
          curl displays the file size only.

          If this option is used twice,  the  second  will  again
          disable header only.

     --krb4 &lt;level&gt;
          (FTP)  Enable  kerberos4  authentication  and  use. The
          level must be entered and should  be  one  of  'clear',
          'safe',  'confidential'  or 'private'. Should you use a
          level that is not one of these, 'private' will  instead
          be used.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -K/--config &lt;config file&gt;
          Specify which config file to read curl arguments  from.
          The  config  file  is a text file in which command line
          arguments can be written which then will be used as  if
          they  were  written on the actual command line. Options
          and their parameters must be specified on the same con­
          fig  file  line.  If  the parameter is to contain white
          spaces, the parameter must be inclosed  within  quotes.
          If  the  first column of a config line is a '#' charac­
          ter, the rest of the line will be treated as a comment.

          Specify  the filename as '-' to make curl read the file
          from stdin.

          This option can be used multiple times.

     -l/--list-only
          (FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this switch forces
          a  name-only  view.   Especially  useful if you want to
          machine-parse the contents of an  FTP  directory  since
          the  normal  directory view doesn't use a standard look
          or format.

          If this option is used twice,  the  second  will  again
          disable list only.

     -L/--location
          (HTTP/HTTPS)  If  the server reports that the requested
          page has  a  different  location  (indicated  with  the
          header  line Location:) this flag will let curl attempt
          to reattempt the get on the new place. If used together
          with -i or -I, headers from all requested pages will be
          shown. If this flag is used when making  a  HTTP  POST,
          curl will automatically switch to GET after the initial
          POST has been done.

          If this option is used twice,  the  second  will  again
          disable location following.

     -m/--max-time &lt;seconds&gt;
          Maximum time in seconds that you allow the whole opera­
          tion to take.  This is useful for preventing your batch
          jobs  from  hanging  for  hours due to slow networks or
          links going down.  This doesn't  work  fully  in  win32
          systems.  See also the <I>--connect-timeout</I> option.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -M/--manual
          Manual. Display the huge help text.

     -n/--netrc
          Makes curl scan the <I>.netrc</I>  file  in  the  user's  home
          directory  for  login  name and password. This is typi­
          cally used for ftp on unix. If  used  with  http,  curl
          will enable user authentication. See <B>netrc(4)</B> or <B>ftp(1)</B>
          for details on the file format. Curl will not  complain
          if  that  file  hasn't the right permissions (it should
          not be world nor group readable). The environment vari­
          able "HOME" is used to find the home directory.

          A  quick  and  very  simple  example  of how to setup a
          <I>.netrc</I>  to  allow  curl   to   ftp   to   the   machine
          host.domain.com  with  user  name 'myself' and password
          'secret' should look similar to:

          <B>machine</B> <B>host.domain.com</B> <B>login</B> <B>myself</B> <B>password</B> <B>secret</B>

          If this option is used twice,  the  second  will  again
          disable netrc usage.

     -N/--no-buffer
          Disables  the buffering of the output stream. In normal
          work situations, curl will use a standard buffered out­
          put  stream that will have the effect that it will out­
          put the data in chunks, not  necessarily  exactly  when
          the  data arrives.  Using this option will disable that
          buffering.

          If this option is used twice,  the  second  will  again
          switch on buffering.

     -o/--output &lt;file&gt;
          Write  output  to  &lt;file&gt; instead of stdout. If you are
          using {} or [] to fetch multiple documents, you can use
          '#'  followed by a number in the &lt;file&gt; specifier. That
          variable will be replaced with the current  string  for
          the URL being fetched. Like in:

            curl http://{one,two}.site.com -o "file_#1.txt"

          or use several variables like:

            curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o "#1_#2"

          You  may use this option as many times as you have num­
          ber of URLs.

     -O/--remote-name
          Write output to a local file named like the remote file
          we get. (Only the file part of the remote file is used,
          the path is cut off.)

          You may use this option as many times as you have  num­
          ber of URLs.

     -p/--proxytunnel
          When an HTTP proxy is used, this option will cause non-
          HTTP protocols to attempt to tunnel through  the  proxy
          instead  of merely using it to do HTTP-like operations.
          The tunnel approach is made with the HTTP proxy CONNECT
          request  and requires that the proxy allows direct con­
          nect to the remote port number  curl  wants  to  tunnel
          through to.

          If  this  option  is  used twice, the second will again
          disable proxy tunnel.

     -P/--ftpport &lt;address&gt;
          (FTP) Reverses the initiator/listener roles  when  con­
          necting  with  ftp. This switch makes Curl use the PORT
          command instead of PASV. In practice,  PORT  tells  the
          server to connect to the client's specified address and
          port, while PASV asks the server for an ip address  and
          port to connect to. &lt;address&gt; should be one of:

          <B>interface</B>   i.e  "eth0" to specify which interface's IP
                      address you want to use  (Unix only)

          <B>IP</B> <B>address</B>  i.e "192.168.10.1" to specify exact IP num­
                      ber

          <B>host</B> <B>name</B>   i.e "my.host.domain" to specify machine

          <B>-</B>           (any  single-letter string) to make it pick
                      the machine's default

     If this option is used several times, the last one  will  be
     used.

     -q   If used as the first parameter on the command line, the
          <I>$HOME/.curlrc</I> file will not be read and used as a  con­
          fig file.

     -Q/--quote &lt;comand&gt;
          (FTP)  Send  an  arbitrary  command  to  the remote FTP
          server, by using the QUOTE command of the  server.  Not
          all  servers support this command, and the set of QUOTE
          commands are server specific! Quote commands  are  sent
          BEFORE  the  transfer is taking place. To make commands
          take place after a  successful  transfer,  prefix  them
          with a dash '-'. You may specify any amount of commands
          to be run before and after the transfer. If the  server
          returns  failure  for  one  of the commands, the entire
          operation will be aborted.

          This option can be used multiple times.

     --random-file &lt;file&gt;
          (HTTPS) Specify the path name to file  containing  what
          will  be considered as random data. The data is used to
          seed the random engine for SSL connections.   See  also
          the <I>--edg-file</I> option.

     -r/--range &lt;range&gt;
          (HTTP/FTP)  Retrieve  a byte range (i.e a partial docu­
          ment) from a HTTP/1.1 or  FTP  server.  Ranges  can  be
          specified in a number of ways.

          <B>0-499</B>     specifies the first 500 bytes

          <B>500-999</B>   specifies the second 500 bytes

          <B>-500</B>      specifies the last 500 bytes

          <B>9500</B>      specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and for­
                    ward

          <B>0-0,-1</B>    specifies the first and last byte only(*)(H)

          <B>500-700,600-799</B>
                    specifies 300 bytes from offset 500(H)

          <B>100-199,500-599</B>
                    specifies two separate 100 bytes ranges(*)(H)

     (*)  =  NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with a
     multipart response!

     You should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers  do  not
     have this feature enabled, so that when you attempt to get a
     range, you'll instead get the whole document.

     FTP range downloads only support the simple  syntax  'start-
     stop'  (optionally  with  one  of  the  numbers omitted). It
     depends on the non-RFC command SIZE.

     If this option is used several times, the last one  will  be
     used.

     -R/--remote-time
          When used, this will make libcurl attempt to figure out
          the timestamp of the remote file, and if that is avail­
          able make the local file get that same timestamp.

          If  this option is used twice, the second time disables
          this again.

     -s/--silent
          Silent mode. Don't show progress meter  or  error  mes­
          sages.  Makes Curl mute.

          If  this  option  is  used twice, the second will again
          disable mute.

     -S/--show-error
          When used with -s it makes curl show error  message  if
          it fails.

          If  this  option  is  used twice, the second will again
          disable show error.

     -t/--telnet-option &lt;OPT=val&gt;
          Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported  options
          are:

          TTYPE=&lt;term&gt; Sets the terminal type.

          XDISPLOC=&lt;X display&gt; Sets the X display location.

          NEW_ENV=&lt;var,val&gt; Sets an environment variable.

     -T/--upload-file &lt;file&gt;
          This  transfers  the specified local file to the remote
          URL. If there is no file part  in  the  specified  URL,
          Curl  will  append  the  local file name. NOTE that you
          must use a trailing / on the last directory  to  really
          prove  to  Curl that there is no file name or curl will
          think that your last directory name is the remote  file
          name  to  use.  That  will most likely cause the upload
          operation to fail. If this is used on a http(s) server,
          the PUT command will be used.

          Use  the  file  name  "-"  (a single dash) to use stdin
          instead of a given file.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -u/--user &lt;user:password&gt;
          Specify  user  and  password  to use when fetching. See
          README.curl for detailed examples of how to  use  this.
          If  no  password  is  specified,  curl  will ask for it
          interactively.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -U/--proxy-user &lt;user:password&gt;
          Specify  user and password to use for Proxy authentica­
          tion. If no password is specified, curl will ask for it
          interactively.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     --url &lt;URL&gt;
          Specify a URL to fetch. This  option  is  mostly  handy
          when you want to specify URL(s) in a config file.

          This option may be used any number of times. To control
          where this URL  is  written,  use  the  <I>-o</I>  or  the  <I>-O</I>
          options.

     -v/--verbose
          Makes   the  fetching  more  verbose/talkative.  Mostly
          usable for debugging. Lines  starting  with  '&gt;'  means
          data sent by curl, '&lt;' means data received by curl that
          is hidden in normal cases and lines starting  with  '*'
          means additional info provided by curl.

          If  this  option  is  used twice, the second will again
          disable verbose.

     -V/--version
          Displays the full version of curl,  libcurl  and  other
          3rd party libraries linked with the executable.

     -w/--write-out &lt;format&gt;
          Defines  what to display after a completed and success­
          ful operation. The format is a string that may  contain
          plain  text  mixed  with  any  number of variables. The
          string can be specified as "string", to get read from a
          particular  file you specify it "@filename" and to tell
          curl to read the format from stdin you write "@-".

          The variables present in the output format will be sub­
          stituted  by the value or text that curl thinks fit, as
          described  below.  All  variables  are  specified  like
          %{variable_name}  and  to  output  a  normal % you just
          write them like %%. You can output a newline  by  using
          \n,  a carriage return with \r and a tab space with \t.

          <B>NOTE:</B>  The  %-letter  is  a  special  letter   in   the
          win32-environment,  where  all occurrences of % must be
          doubled when using this option.

          Available variables are at this point:

          <B>url_effective</B>  The URL that was fetched last.  This  is
                         mostly meaningful if you've told curl to
                         follow location: headers.

          <B>http_code</B>      The numerical code that was found in the
                         last retrieved HTTP(S) page.

          <B>time_total</B>     The  total  time,  in  seconds, that the
                         full operation lasted. The time will  be
                         displayed with millisecond resolution.

          <B>time_namelookup</B>
                         The  time,  in seconds, it took from the
                         start until the name resolving was  com­
                         pleted.

          <B>time_connect</B>   The  time,  in seconds, it took from the
                         start until the connect  to  the  remote
                         host (or proxy) was completed.

          <B>time_pretransfer</B>
                         The  time,  in seconds, it took from the
                         start until the file  transfer  is  just
                         about  to  begin. This includes all pre-
                         transfer commands and negotiations  that
                         are  specific  to  the particular proto­
                         col(s) involved.

          <B>time_starttransfer</B>
                         The time, in seconds, it took  from  the
                         start until the first byte is just about
                         to   be   transfered.   This    includes
                         time_pretransfer  and  also the time the
                         server needs to calculate the result.

          <B>size_download</B>  The total  amount  of  bytes  that  were
                         downloaded.

          <B>size_upload</B>    The  total  amount  of  bytes  that were
                         uploaded.

          <B>size_header</B>    The total amount of bytes of  the  down­
                         loaded headers.

          <B>size_request</B>   The total amount of bytes that were sent
                         in the HTTP request.

          <B>speed_download</B> The average  download  speed  that  curl
                         measured for the complete download.

          <B>speed_upload</B>   The  average upload speed that curl mea­
                         sured for the complete upload.

          <B>content_type</B>   The Content-Type of the requested  docu­
                         ment, if there was any. (Added in 7.9.5)

     If this option is used several times, the last one  will  be
     used.

     -x/--proxy &lt;proxyhost[:port]&gt;
          Use  specified  HTTP  proxy.  If the port number is not
          specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

          <B>Note</B> that all operations that are performed over a HTTP
          proxy will transparantly be converted to HTTP. It means
          that certain protocol specific operations might not  be
          available.  This  is  not  the  case  if you can tunnel
          through the proxy, as done  with  the  <I>-p/--proxytunnel</I>
          option.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -X/--request &lt;command&gt;
          (HTTP) Specifies a custom request to use when  communi­
          cating  with  the  HTTP  server.  The specified request
          will be used instead of the standard GET. Read the HTTP
          1.1 specification for details and explanations.

          (FTP)  Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of
          LIST when doing file lists with ftp.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -y/--speed-time &lt;time&gt;
          If a download is slower than speed-limit bytes per sec­
          ond during  a  speed-time  period,  the  download  gets
          aborted. If speed-time is used, the default speed-limit
          will be 1 unless set with -y.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -Y/--speed-limit &lt;speed&gt;
          If a download is slower than this given speed, in bytes
          per second, for speed-time  seconds  it  gets  aborted.
          speed-time is set with -Y and is 30 if not set.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -z/--time-cond &lt;date expression&gt;
          (HTTP) Request to get a file  that  has  been  modified
          later  than  the  given  time and date, or one that has
          been modified before that time. The date expression can
          be all sorts of date strings or if it doesn't match any
          internal ones, it tries to get the time  from  a  given
          file  name  instead!  See  the <B>GNU</B> <B>date(1)</B> or <B>curl_get­</B>
          <B>date(3)</B> man pages for date expression details.

          Start the date expression with a dash (-)  to  make  it
          request  for  a  document  that is older than the given
          date/time, default is a document that is newer than the
          specified date/time.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

     -3/--sslv3
          (HTTPS) Forces curl to use SSL version 3 when negotiat­
          ing with a remote SSL server.

     -2/--sslv2
          (HTTPS) Forces curl to use SSL version 2 when negotiat­
          ing with a remote SSL server.

     -0/--http1.0
          (HTTP) Forces curl to issue its requests using HTTP 1.0
          instead of using its internally preferred: HTTP 1.1.

     -#/--progress-bar
          Make  curl  display  progress information as a progress
          bar instead of the default statistics.

          If this option is used twice,  the  second  will  again
          disable the progress bar.

     --crlf
          (FTP)  Convert  LF  to  CRLF  in upload. Useful for MVS
          (OS/390).

          If this option is used twice,  the  second  will  again
          disable crlf converting.

     --stderr &lt;file&gt;
          Redirect  all  writes  to  stderr to the specified file
          instead. If the file name is a plain '-', it is instead
          written to stdout. This option has no point when you're
          using a shell with decent redirecting capabilities.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will
          be used.

<H2>EXIT CODES</H2><PRE>
     There exists a bunch of different error codes and their cor­
     responding error messages that may appear during bad  condi­
     tions. At the time of this writing, the exit codes are:

     1    Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support
          for this protocol.

     2    Failed to initialize.

     3    URL malformat. The syntax was not correct.

     4    URL user malformatted. The user-part of the URL  syntax
          was not correct.

     5    Couldn't  resolve proxy. The given proxy host could not
          be resolved.

     6    Couldn't resolve host. The given remote  host  was  not
          resolved.
