.TH curl_global_init 3 "13 Nov 2001" "libcurl 7.9.1" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_global_init - Global libcurl initialisation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLcode curl_global_init(long " flags ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function should only be called once (no matter how many threads or
libcurl sessions that'll be used) by every application that uses libcurl.

If this function hasn't been invoked when \fIcurl_easy_init\fP is called, it
will be done automatically by libcurl.

The flags option is a bit pattern that tells libcurl exact what features to
init, as described below. Set the desired bits by ORing the values together.

You must however \fBalways\fP use the \fIcurl_global_cleanup\fP function, as
that cannot be called automatically for you by libcurl.

Calling this function more than once will cause unpredictable results.

This function was added in libcurl 7.8.
