     curl_easy_perform - Perform a file transfer


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</B>

     <B>CURLcode</B> <B>curl_easy_perform(CURL</B> <B>*</B><I>handle</I><B>);</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     This   function  is  called  after  the  init  and  all  the
     curl_easy_setopt() calls are  made,  and  will  perform  the
     transfer  as  described  in  the options.  It must be called
     with the same <I>handle</I> as input  as  the  curl_easy_init  call
     returned.

     libcurl version 7.7 or later (for older versions see below):
     You can do any amount of calls to curl_easy_perform()  while
     using  the  same handle. If you intend to transfer more than
     one file, you are even encouraged to  do  so.  libcurl  will
     then attempt to re-use the same connection for the following
     transfers, thus  making  the  operations  faster,  less  CPU
     intense and using less network resources. Just note that you
     will have to use <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>setopt</I> between the invokes to set
     options for the following curl_easy_perform.

     You  must  never  call this function simultaneously from two
     places using the same handle. Let the function return  first
     before invoking it another time. If you want parallel trans­
     fers, you must use several curl handles.

     Before libcurl version 7.7: You are  only  allowed  to  call
     this  function once using the same handle. If you want to do
     repeated  calls,  you  must   call   curl_easy_cleanup   and
     curl_easy_init again first.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     0  means everything was ok, non-zero means an error occurred
     as <I>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</I> defines. If the CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER was set
     with <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>setopt</I> there will be a readable error message
     in the error buffer when non-zero is returned.
