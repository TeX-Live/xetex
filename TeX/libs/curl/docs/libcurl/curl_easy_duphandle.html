     curl_easy_duphandle - Clone a libcurl session handle


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</B>

     <B>CURL</B> <B>*curl_easy_duphandle(CURL</B> <B>*</B><I>handle</I><B>);</B>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     This  function  will  return a new curl handle, a duplicate,
     using all the options previously set in the input curl  <I>han­</I>
     <I>dle</I>. Both handles can subsequently be used independently and
     they must both be freed with <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>cleanup()</I>.

     All strings that the input handle has been told to point  to
     (as opposed to copy) with previous calls to <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>setopt</I>
     using char * inputs, will be pointed to by the new handle as
     well.  You  must therefore make sure to keep the data around
     until both handles have been cleaned up.

     The new handle will <B>not</B> inherit any  state  information,  no
     connections, no SSL sessions and no cookies.

     <B>Note</B>  that  even  in  multi-threaded programs, this function
     must be called in a synchronous way, the  input  handle  may
     not be in use when cloned.

     This function was added in libcurl 7.9.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     If  this  function returns NULL, something went wrong and no
     valid handle was returned.
