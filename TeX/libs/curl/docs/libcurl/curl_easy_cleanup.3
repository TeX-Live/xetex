.SH NAME
curl_easy_cleanup - End a libcurl easy session
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "void curl_easy_cleanup(CURL *" handle ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function must be the last function to call for an easy session. It is the
opposite of the \fIcurl_easy_init\fP function and must be called with the same
\fIhandle\fP as input that the curl_easy_init call returned.

This will effectively close all connections this handle has used and possibly
has kept open until now. Don't call this function if you intend to transfer
more files.
.SH RETURN VALUE
None
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR curl_easy_init "(3), "
