     curl_easy_setopt - Set curl easy-session options


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

     CURLcode  curl_easy_setopt(CURL  *handle, CURLoption option,
     parameter);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     curl_easy_setopt() is used to tell libcurl  how  to  behave.
     Most  operations  in  libcurl  have  default actions, and by
     using the appropriate options to <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>setopt</I>,  you  can
     change  them.   All options are set with the <I>option</I> followed
     by a <I>parameter</I>. That parameter can be  a  long,  a  function
     pointer or an object pointer, all depending on what the spe­
     cific option expects. Read  this  manual  carefully  as  bad
     input  values  may  cause  libcurl to behave badly!  You can
     only set one option in each function call. A typical  appli­
     cation  uses  many  curl_easy_setopt()  calls  in  the setup
     phase.

     <B>NOTE:</B> strings passed to libcurl as 'char *' arguments,  will
     not  be  copied by the library. Instead you should keep them
     available until libcurl no longer needs them. Failing to  do
     so will cause very odd behavior or even crashes.

     <B>NOTE2:</B> options set with this function call are valid for the
     forthcoming data  transfers  that  are  performed  when  you
     invoke  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I>.   The  options are not in any way
     reset between transfers, so if you want subsequent transfers
     with  different  options,  you  must change them between the
     transfers.

     The <I>handle</I> is the return code from  a  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>init(3)</I>  or
     <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>duphandle(3)</I> call.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The options are listed in a sort of random order, but you'll
     figure it out!

     <B>CURLOPT_FILE</B>
             Data pointer to pass to  the  file  write  function.
             Note  that if you specify the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>WRITEFUNCTION</I>,
             this is the pointer you'll  get  as  input.  If  you
             don't  use  a  callback, you must pass a 'FILE *' as
             libcurl will pass  this  to  fwrite()  when  writing
             data.

             <B>NOTE:</B>  If  you're  using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you
             MUST use the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>WRITEFUNCTION</I> if you  set  this
             option or you will experience crashes.

     <B>CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION</B>
             Function  pointer  that  should  match the following
             prototype: <B>size_t</B> <B>function(</B> <B>void</B> <B>*ptr,</B> <B>size_t</B>  <B>size,</B>
             <B>size_t</B>  <B>nmemb,</B>  <B>void</B>  <B>*stream);</B>  This  function gets
             called by libcurl as soon as there is data available
             to  pass  available that needs to be saved. The size
             of the data pointed to by  <I>ptr</I>  is  <I>size</I>  multiplied
             with  <I>nmemb</I>.   Return  the  number of bytes actually
             taken care of.  If  that  amount  differs  from  the
             amount  passed  to  your  function,  it'll signal an
             error to the library and it will abort the  transfer
             and return <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>WRITE</I><B>_</B><I>ERROR</I>.

             Set   the  <I>stream</I>  argument  with  the  <B>CURLOPT_FILE</B>
             option.

             <B>NOTE:</B> you will be passed as much data as possible in
             all  invokes,  but  you  cannot  possibly  make  any
             assumptions. It may be one byte,  it  may  be  thou­
             sands.

     <B>CURLOPT_INFILE</B>
             Data pointer to pass to the file read function. Note
             that if you specify the  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>READFUNCTION</I>,  this
             is  the  pointer  you'll  get as input. If you don't
             specify a read callback, this must be a  valid  FILE
             *.

             <B>NOTE:</B>  If  you're  using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you
             MUST use a  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>READFUNCTION</I>  if  you  set  this
             option.

     <B>CURLOPT_READFUNCTION</B>
             Function  pointer  that  should  match the following
             prototype: <B>size_t</B> <B>function(</B> <B>void</B> <B>*ptr,</B> <B>size_t</B>  <B>size,</B>
             <B>size_t</B>  <B>nmemb,</B>  <B>void</B>  <B>*stream);</B>  This  function gets
             called by libcurl as soon as it needs to  read  data
             in  order  to  send  it  to  the peer. The data area
             pointed at by the pointer <I>ptr</I> may be filled with  at
             most  <I>size</I>  multiplied  with  <I>nmemb</I> number of bytes.
             Your function must return the actual number of bytes
             that  you  stored  in  that memory area. Returning 0
             will signal end-of-file to the library and cause  it
             to stop the current transfer.

     <B>CURLOPT_INFILESIZE</B>
             When  uploading a file to a remote site, this option
             should be used to tell  libcurl  what  the  expected
             size of the infile is.

     <B>CURLOPT_URL</B>
             The actual URL to deal with. The parameter should be
             a char * to a zero  terminated  string.  The  string
             must  remain  present until curl no longer needs it,
             as it doesn't copy the string.

             <B>NOTE:</B> this option is (the only one) required  to  be
             set before <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>perform(3)</I> is called.

     <B>CURLOPT_PROXY</B>
             Set  HTTP  proxy  to  use. The parameter should be a
             char * to a zero terminated string holding the  host
             name or dotted IP address. To specify port number in
             this string, append :[port] to the end of  the  host
             name.  The proxy string may be prefixed with [proto­
             col]:// since any such prefix will be  ignored.  The
             proxy's port number may optionally be specified with
             the separate option <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PROXYPORT</I>.

             <B>NOTE:</B> when you tell the library to use a HTTP proxy,
             libcurl  will  transparently  convert  operations to
             HTTP even if you specify a FTP  URL  etc.  This  may
             have an impact on what other features of the library
             you can use, such as CURLOPT_QUOTE and  similar  FTP
             specifics  that don't work unless you tunnel through
             the HTTP proxy. Such  tunneling  is  activated  with
             <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTPPROXYTUNNEL</I>.

             <B>NOTE2:</B>  libcurl  respects  the environment variables
             <B>http_proxy</B>, <B>ftp_proxy</B>,  <B>all_proxy</B>  etc,  if  any  of
             those is set.

     <B>CURLOPT_PROXYPORT</B>
             Pass  a  long with this option to set the proxy port
             to connect to unless it is specified  in  the  proxy
             string <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PROXY</I>.

     <B>CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL</B>
             Set  the parameter to non-zero to get the library to
             tunnel all operations through a  given  HTTP  proxy.
             Note  that there is a big difference between using a
             proxy and to tunnel through it. If  you  don't  know
             what  this  means, you probably don't want this tun­
             neling option. (Added in libcurl 7.3)

     <B>CURLOPT_VERBOSE</B>
             Set the parameter to non-zero to get the library  to
             display a lot of verbose information about its oper­
             ations. Very  useful  for  libcurl  and/or  protocol
             debugging and understanding.

             You hardly ever want this set in production use, you
             will almost always want this when  you  debug/report
             problems.

     <B>CURLOPT_HEADER</B>
             A  non-zero  parameter  tells the library to include
             the header in the body output. This is only relevant
             for  protocols  that actually have headers preceding
             the data (like HTTP).

     <B>CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS</B>
             A non-zero parameter tells the library  to  shut  of
             the built-in progress meter completely.

             <B>NOTE:</B>  future  versions  of libcurl is likely to not
             have any built-in progress meter at all.

     <B>CURLOPT_NOBODY</B>
             A  non-zero  parameter  tells  the  library  to  not
             include  the  body-part  in the output. This is only
             relevant for protocols that have separate header and
             body parts.

     <B>CURLOPT_FAILONERROR</B>
             A  non-zero  parameter  tells  the  library  to fail
             silently if the HTTP code returned is  equal  to  or
             larger  than  300.  The  default  action would be to
             return the page normally, ignoring that code.

     <B>CURLOPT_UPLOAD</B>
             A non-zero parameter tells the  library  to  prepare
             for   an   upload.   The   CURLOPT_INFILE  and  CUR­
             LOPT_INFILESIZE are also interesting for uploads.

     <B>CURLOPT_POST</B>
             A non-zero parameter tells the library to do a regu­
             lar  HTTP  post. This is a normal application/x-www-
             form-urlencoded kind, which  is  the  most  commonly
             used  one  by HTML forms. See the CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS
             option for how to specify the data to post and  CUR­
             LOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE  in  how  to  set  the data size.
             Starting with libcurl 7.8, this option is  obsolete.
             Using  the CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS option will imply this
             option.

     <B>CURLOPT_FTPLISTONLY</B>
             A non-zero parameter tells the library to just  list
             the  names  of  an ftp directory, instead of doing a
             full  directory  listing  that  would  include  file
             sizes, dates etc.

     <B>CURLOPT_FTPAPPEND</B>
             A  non-zero parameter tells the library to append to
             the remote file instead of  overwrite  it.  This  is
             only useful when uploading to a ftp site.

     <B>CURLOPT_NETRC</B>
             A  non-zero parameter tells the library to scan your
             <I>~/.netrc</I> file to find user name and password for the
             remote  site  you  are about to access. Only machine
             name, user name and password is taken  into  account
             (init macros and similar things aren't supported).

             <B>Note:</B>  libcurl does not verify that the file has the
             correct properties set (as  the  standard  Unix  ftp
             client does). It should only be readable by user.

     <B>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION</B>
             A non-zero parameter tells the library to follow any
             Location: header that the server sends as part of  a
             HTTP header.

             <B>NOTE:</B>  this  means that the library will re-send the
             same request on the  new  location  and  follow  new
             Location:  headers  all  the  way until no more such
             headers are returned. <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>MAXREDIRS</I> can be  used
             to  limit  the number of redirects libcurl will fol­
             low.

     <B>CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT</B>
             A non-zero parameter tells the library to use  ASCII
             mode  for  ftp  transfers,  instead  of  the default
             binary transfer. For LDAP transfers it gets the data
             in  plain text instead of HTML and for win32 systems
             it does not set the  stdout  to  binary  mode.  This
             option  can  be  usable  when transferring text data
             between systems  with  different  views  on  certain
             characters, such as newlines or similar.

     <B>CURLOPT_PUT</B>
             A  non-zero  parameter tells the library to use HTTP
             PUT to transfer data. The data should  be  set  with
             CURLOPT_INFILE and CURLOPT_INFILESIZE.

     <B>CURLOPT_USERPWD</B>
             Pass  a  char  * as parameter, which should be [user
             name]:[password] to use for the connection.  If  the
             password  is  left out, you will be prompted for it.
             <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDFUNCTION</I> can be used to set  your  own
             prompt function.

     <B>CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD</B>
             Pass  a  char  * as parameter, which should be [user
             name]:[password] to use for the  connection  to  the
             HTTP proxy. If the password is left out, you will be
             prompted for it. <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDFUNCTION</I> can be  used
             to set your own prompt function.

     <B>CURLOPT_RANGE</B>
             Pass a char * as parameter, which should contain the
             specified range you want. It should be in the format
             "X-Y",  where X or Y may be left out. HTTP transfers
             also support several intervals, separated with  com­
             mas  as  in  <I>"X-Y,N-M"</I>.  Using this kind of multiple
             intervals will cause the HTTP  server  to  send  the
             response  document  in  pieces  (using standard MIME
             separation techniques).

     <B>CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER</B>
             Pass a char * to a buffer that the libcurl may store
             human  readable  error messages in. This may be more
             helpful than just the return code from the  library.
             The buffer must be at least CURL_ERROR_SIZE big.

             <B>Note:</B>  if  the library does not return an error, the
             buffer may not have been touched. Do not rely on the
             contents in those cases.

     <B>CURLOPT_TIMEOUT</B>
             Pass a long as parameter containing the maximum time
             in seconds that you allow the libcurl transfer oper­
             ation  to  take.  Normally,  name lookups can take a
             considerable time and limiting  operations  to  less
             than  a  few  minutes risk aborting perfectly normal
             operations. This option will cause curl to  use  the
             SIGALRM to enable time-outing system calls.

             <B>NOTE:</B> this does not work in Unix multi-threaded pro­
             grams, as it uses signals.

     <B>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS</B>
             Pass a char * as parameter, which should be the full
             data  to  post  in  a HTTP post operation. This is a
             normal application/x-www-form-urlencoded kind, which
             is  the  most  commonly  used one by HTML forms. See
             also  the  CURLOPT_POST.  Since  7.8,   using   CUR­
             LOPT_POSTFIELDS implies CURLOPT_POST.

             <B>Note:</B>   to   make   multipart/formdata   posts  (aka
             rfc1867-posts),  check  out   the   <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTPPOST</I>
             option.

     <B>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE</B>
             If  you want to post data to the server without let­
             ting libcurl do a strlen() to measure the data size,
             this  option  must be used. When this option is used
             you can post fully binary data, which  otherwise  is
             likely  to  fail.  If  this size is set to zero, the
             library will use strlen() to get the size. (Added in
             libcurl 7.2)

     <B>CURLOPT_REFERER</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter. It will be used to set the Referer: header  in
             the http request sent to the remote server. This can
             be used to fool servers or scripts. You can also set
             any custom header with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTPHEADER</I>.

     <B>CURLOPT_USERAGENT</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter. It will be used to set the User-Agent:  header
             in  the http request sent to the remote server. This
             can be used to fool servers or scripts. You can also
             set any custom header with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTPHEADER</I>.

     <B>CURLOPT_FTPPORT</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter. It will be used to get the IP address  to  use
             for  the  ftp PORT instruction. The PORT instruction
             tells the remote server to connect to our  specified
             IP  address. The string may be a plain IP address, a
             host name, an network interface name (under Unix) or
             just  a  '-' letter to let the library use your sys­
             tems default IP address. Default FTP operations  are
             passive, and thus won't use PORT.

     <B>CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT</B>
             Pass  a  long as parameter. It contains the transfer
             speed in bytes per second that the  transfer  should
             be  below  during CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME seconds for
             the library to consider it too slow and abort.

     <B>CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME</B>
             Pass a long as parameter. It contains  the  time  in
             seconds  that  the transfer should be below the CUR­
             LOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT for the library to consider  it
             too slow and abort.

     <B>CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM</B>
             Pass  a long as parameter. It contains the offset in
             number of bytes that you want the transfer to  start
             from.

     <B>CURLOPT_COOKIE</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter. It will be used to set a cookie  in  the  http
             request.   The   format  of  the  string  should  be
             [NAME]=[CONTENTS]; Where NAME is the cookie name.

     <B>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER</B>
             Pass a pointer to a linked list of HTTP  headers  to
             pass  to the server in your HTTP request. The linked
             list  should  be  a  fully  valid  list  of   <B>struct</B>
             <B>curl_slist</B>   structs   properly   filled   in.   Use
             <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>append(3)</I>  to   create   the   list   and
             <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>free</I><B>_</B><I>all(3)</I>  to  clean up an entire list.
             If you add a header that is otherwise generated  and
             used  by  libcurl internally, your added one will be
             used instead. If you add a header with  no  contents
             as  in  'Accept:'  (no data on the right side of the
             colon), the internally used  header  will  get  dis­
             abled. Thus, using this option you can add new head­
             ers, replace internal headers  and  remove  internal
             headers.

             <B>NOTE:</B>The most commonly replaced headers have "short­
             cuts" in the options CURLOPT_COOKIE,  CURLOPT_USERA­
             GENT and CURLOPT_REFERER.

     <B>CURLOPT_HTTPPOST</B>
             Tells  libcurl  you  want  a multipart/formdata HTTP
             POST to be made and you instruct what data  to  pass
             on  to  the server.  Pass a pointer to a linked list
             of HTTP post structs as parameter.  The linked  list
             should  be  a  fully valid list of 'struct HttpPost'
             structs properly filled in. The best and  most  ele­
             gant  way  to  do this, is to use <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>formadd(3)</I> as
             documented. The data  in  this  list  must  remained
             intact  until  you close this curl handle again with
             <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>cleanup(3)</I>.

     <B>CURLOPT_SSLCERT</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter.  The  string  should  be the file name of your
             certificate. The default format is "PEM" and can  be
             changed with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLCERTTYPE</I>.

     <B>CURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter. The string should be the format of  your  cer­
             tificate.  Supported  formats  are  "PEM" and "DER".
             (Added in 7.9.3)

     <B>CURLOPT_SSLCERTPASSWD</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter.  It  will  be used as the password required to
             use the CURLOPT_SSLCERT certificate. If the password
             is  not  supplied, you will be prompted for it. <I>CUR­</I>
             <I>LOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDFUNCTION</I> can be  used  to  set  your  own
             prompt function.

             <B>NOTE:</B>This option is replaced by <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLKEYPASSWD</I>
             and only cept for backward compatibility. You  never
             needed  a  pass phrase to load a certificate but you
             need one to load your private key.

     <B>CURLOPT_SSLKEY</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter.  The  string  should  be the file name of your
             private key. The default format is "PEM" and can  be
             changed with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLKEYTYPE</I>. (Added in 7.9.3)

     <B>CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter. The string should be the format of  your  pri­
             vate  key.  Supported  formats  are "PEM", "DER" and
             "ENG".  (Added in 7.9.3)

             <B>NOTE:</B>The format "ENG" enables you to load  the  pri­
             vate  key  from  a  crypto engine. in this case <I>CUR­</I>
             <I>LOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLKEY</I> is used as an identifier passed  to  the
             engine.  You have to set the crypto engine with <I>CUR­</I>
             <I>LOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSL</I><B>_</B><I>ENGINE</I>.

     <B>CURLOPT_SSLKEYASSWD</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter.  It  will  be used as the password required to
             use the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLKEY</I> private key. If the  password
             is  not  supplied, you will be prompted for it. <I>CUR­</I>
             <I>LOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDFUNCTION</I> can be  used  to  set  your  own
             prompt function.  (Added in 7.9.3)

     <B>CURLOPT_SSL_ENGINE</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter. It will be used  as  the  identifier  for  the
             crypto  engine you want to use for your private key.
             (Added in 7.9.3)

             <B>NOTE:</B>If  the  crypto  device   cannot   be   loaded,
             <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>SSL</I><B>_</B><I>ENGINE</I><B>_</B><I>NOTFOUND</I> is returned.

     <B>CURLOPT_SSL_ENGINEDEFAULT</B>
             Sets  the  actual  crypto  engine as the default for
             (asymetric) crypto operations. (Added in 7.9.3)

             <B>NOTE:</B>If   the   crypto   device   cannot   be   set,
             <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>SSL</I><B>_</B><I>ENGINE</I><B>_</B><I>SETFAILED</I> is returned.

     <B>CURLOPT_CRLF</B>
             Convert  Unix  newlines  to  CRLF  newlines  on  FTP
             uploads.

     <B>CURLOPT_QUOTE</B>
             Pass a pointer to a linked list of FTP  commands  to
             pass  to  the  server prior to your ftp request. The
             linked list should be a fully valid list of  'struct
             curl_slist'   structs   properly   filled   in.  Use
             <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>append(3)</I> to append strings (commands) to
             the  list, and clear the entire list afterwards with
             <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>free</I><B>_</B><I>all(3)</I>. Disable this operation again
             by setting a NULL to this option.

     <B>CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE</B>
             Pass  a  pointer to a linked list of FTP commands to
             pass to the server after your ftp transfer  request.
             The  linked  list  should  be  a fully valid list of
             struct curl_slist  structs  properly  filled  in  as
             described  for <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>QUOTE</I>. Disable this operation
             again by setting a NULL to this option.

     <B>CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER</B>
             Pass a pointer to be used to write the  header  part
             of  the  received data to. If you don't use your own
             callback to take care of the writing, this must be a
             valid  FILE  *.  See also the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HEADERFUNCTION</I>
             option below on how to set a custom  get-all-headers
             callback.

     <B>CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION</B>
             Function  pointer  that  should  match the following
             prototype: <I>size</I><B>_</B><I>t</I> <I>function(</I> <I>void</I> <I>*ptr,</I> <I>size</I><B>_</B><I>t</I>  <I>size,</I>
             <I>size</I><B>_</B><I>t</I>  <I>nmemb,</I>  <I>void</I>  <I>*stream);</I>.  This function gets
             called by libcurl  as  soon  as  there  is  received
             header data that needs to be written down. The head­
             ers are guaranteed to be written one-by-one and only
             complete  lines  are written. Parsing headers should
             be easy enough using this.  The  size  of  the  data
             pointed  to  by  <I>ptr</I>  is <I>size</I> multiplied with <I>nmemb</I>.
             The pointer named <I>stream</I> will be the one you  passed
             to  libcurl  with  the  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>WRITEHEADER</I>  option.
             Return the  number  of  bytes  actually  written  or
             return  -1  to  signal error to the library (it will
             cause   it   to   abort   the   transfer   with    a
             <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>WRITE</I><B>_</B><I>ERROR</I>  return  code).  (Added in libcurl
             7.7.2)

     <B>CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter.  It should contain the name of your file hold­
             ing cookie data. The cookie data may be in  Netscape
             /  Mozilla  cookie data format or just regular HTTP-
             style headers dumped to a file.

     <B>CURLOPT_SSLVERSION</B>
             Pass a long as parameter. Set what version of SSL to
             attempt  to use, 2 or 3. By default, the SSL library
             will try to  solve  this  by  itself  although  some
             servers  make  this  difficult  why you at times may
             have to use this option.

     <B>CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION</B>
             Pass a long as parameter. This defines how the  CUR­
             LOPT_TIMEVALUE  time  value  is treated. You can set
             this  parameter  to  TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE  or   TIME­
             COND_IFUNMODSINCE.  This  is  a  HTTP-only  feature.
             (TBD)

     <B>CURLOPT_TIMEVALUE</B>
             Pass a long as parameter. This should be the time in
             seconds  since 1 jan 1970, and the time will be used
             as specified in  CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION  or  if  that
             isn't   used,  it  will  be  TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE  by
             default.

     <B>CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter.  It  will  be user instead of GET or HEAD when
             doing the HTTP request. This  is  useful  for  doing
             DELETE  or other more or less obscure HTTP requests.
             Don't do this at will, make sure  your  server  sup­
             ports the command first.

     <B>CURLOPT_STDERR</B>
             Pass  a  FILE  * as parameter. This is the stream to
             use instead  of  stderr  internally  when  reporting
             errors.

     <B>CURLOPT_INTERFACE</B>
             Pass  a  char * as parameter. This set the interface
             name to use as outgoing network interface. The  name
             can  be  an  interface name, an IP address or a host
             name. (Added in libcurl 7.3)

     <B>CURLOPT_KRB4LEVEL</B>
             Pass a char * as parameter. Set  the  krb4  security
             level,  this also enables krb4 awareness.  This is a
             string, 'clear',  'safe',  'confidential'  or  'pri­
             vate'.   If  the string is set but doesn't match one
             of these, 'private' will be used. Set the string  to
             NULL to disable kerberos4. The kerberos support only
             works for FTP. (Added in libcurl 7.3)

     <B>CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION</B>
             Function   pointer    that    should    match    the
             <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>progress</I><B>_</B><I>callback</I>     prototype     found    in
             <I>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</I>. This function gets called by  libcurl
             instead  of  its internal equivalent with a frequent
             interval during data transfer.  Unknown/unused argu­
             ment  values  will  be set to zero (like if you only
             download data,  the  upload  size  will  remain  0).
             Returning  a  non-zero value from this callback will
             cause libcurl  to  abort  the  transfer  and  return
             <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>ABORTED</I><B>_</B><I>BY</I><B>_</B><I>CALLBACK</I>.

     <B>CURLOPT_PROGRESSDATA</B>
             Pass a pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and
             passed as the first argument in the  progress  call­
             back set with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PROGRESSFUNCTION</I>.

     <B>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER</B>
             Pass  a long that is set to a non-zero value to make
             curl verify the peer's certificate. The  certificate
             to  verify  against  must be specified with the CUR­
             LOPT_CAINFO option. (Added in 7.4.2)

     <B>CURLOPT_CAINFO</B>
             Pass a char * to a zero terminated file naming hold­
             ing  the  certificate  to verify the peer with. This
             only makes sense when used in combination  with  the
             CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option. (Added in 7.4.2)

     <B>CURLOPT_PASSWDFUNCTION</B>
             Pass  a  pointer  to a <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>passwd</I><B>_</B><I>callback</I> function
             that will be called instead of the internal  one  if
             libcurl requests a password. The function must match
             this prototype: <B>int</B>  <B>my_getpass(void</B>  <B>*client,</B>  <B>char</B>
             <B>*prompt,</B>  <B>char*</B>  <B>buffer,</B>  <B>int</B>  <B>buflen</B> <B>);</B>.  If set to
             NULL, it equals to making the function always  fail.
             If  the  function  returns a non-zero value, it will
             abort the operation and  an  error  (CURLE_BAD_PASS­
             WORD_ENTERED) will be returned.  <I>client</I> is a generic
             pointer, see <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDDATA</I>.  <I>prompt</I> is a  zero-
             terminated  string  that  is  text that prefixes the
             input request.  <I>buffer</I> is a pointer  to  data  where
             the  entered password should be stored and <I>buflen</I> is
             the maximum number of bytes that may be  written  in
             the buffer.  (Added in 7.4.2)

     <B>CURLOPT_PASSWDDATA</B>
             Pass  a void * to whatever data you want. The passed
             pointer will be  the  first  argument  sent  to  the
             specifed  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDFUNCTION</I> function. (Added in
             7.4.2)

     <B>CURLOPT_FILETIME</B>
             Pass a long. If it is a non-zero value, libcurl will
             attempt  to  get the modification date of the remote
             document in this operation. This requires  that  the
             remote  server  sends  the time or replies to a time
             querying command. The <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>getinfo(3)</I>  function
             with  the  <I>CURLINFO</I><B>_</B><I>FILETIME</I>  argument  can  be used
             after a transfer to extract the  received  time  (if
             any). (Added in 7.5)

     <B>CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS</B>
             Pass  a long. The set number will be the redirection
             limit. If that many redirections have been followed,
             the    next    redirect    will   cause   an   error
             (<I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>TOO</I><B>_</B><I>MANY</I><B>_</B><I>REDIRECTS</I>). This option  only  makes
             sense  if  the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>FOLLOWLOCATION</I> is used at the
             same time. (Added in 7.5)

     <B>CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS</B>
             Pass a long. The set number will be  the  persistant
             connection  cache  size.  The set amount will be the
             maximum  amount  of  simultaneous  connections  that
             libcurl may cache between file transfers. Default is
             5, and there isn't much point in changing this value
             unless  you are perfectly aware of how this work and
             changes libcurl's behaviour.

             <B>NOTE:</B> if you already have performed  transfers  with
             this curl handle, setting a smaller MAXCONNECTS than
             before may cause  open  connections  to  get  closed
             unnecessarily. (Added in 7.7)

     <B>CURLOPT_CLOSEPOLICY</B>
             Pass  a  long.  This option sets what policy libcurl
             should use when the connection cache is  filled  and
             one of the open connections has to be closed to make
             room for a new connection. This must be one  of  the
             CURLCLOSEPOLICY_*    defines.    Use   <I>CURLCLOSEPOL­</I>
             <I>ICY</I><B>_</B><I>LEAST</I><B>_</B><I>RECENTLY</I><B>_</B><I>USED</I> to make  libcurl  close  the
             connection  that  was least recently used, that con­
             nection is also least likely to be  capable  of  re-
             use.  Use  <I>CURLCLOSEPOLICY</I><B>_</B><I>OLDEST</I>  to  make  libcurl
             close the oldest connection, the one that  was  cre­
             ated  first  among the ones in the connection cache.
             The other close policies are not support yet. (Added
             in 7.7)

     <B>CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT</B>
             Pass a long. Set to non-zero to make the next trans­
             fer use a new (fresh) connection by  force.  If  the
             connection cache is full before this connection, one
             of  the  existing  connections  will  be  closed  as
             according  to  the  selected or default policy. This
             option should be used with caution and only  if  you
             understand  what  it  does.  Set  this  to 0 to have
             libcurl  attempt  re-using  an  existing  connection
             (default behavior).  (Added in 7.7)

     <B>CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE</B>
             Pass a long. Set to non-zero to make the next trans­
             fer explicitly close the connection when done.  Nor­
             mally,  libcurl keep all connections alive when done
             with one transfer in case there comes  a  succeeding
             one  that  can  re-use  them.  This option should be
             used with caution and only if you understand what it
             does.  Set  to 0 to have libcurl keep the connection
             open for possibly later re-use  (default  behavior).
             (Added in 7.7)

     <B>CURLOPT_RANDOM_FILE</B>
             Pass  a  char  * to a zero terminated file name. The
             file will be used to read from to  seed  the  random
             engine  for  SSL. The more random the specified file
             is, the more secure will the SSL connection  become.

     <B>CURLOPT_EGDSOCKET</B>
             Pass  a  char  * to the zero terminated path name to
             the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. It will be used
             to seed the random engine for SSL.

     <B>CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT</B>
             Pass  a  long. It should contain the maximum time in
             seconds that you allow the connection to the  server
             to  take.   This  only  limits the connection phase,
             once it has connected, this option  is  of  no  more
             use.  Set  to zero to disable connection timeout (it
             will then only  timeout  on  the  system's  internal
             timeouts). See also the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>TIMEOUT</I> option.

             <B>NOTE:</B> this does not work in unix multi-threaded pro­
             grams, as it uses signals.

     <B>CURLOPT_HTTPGET</B>
             Pass a long. If the long is  non-zero,  this  forces
             the  HTTP  request  to  get back to GET. Only really
             usable if POST, PUT or a custom  request  have  been
             used  previously  using the same curl handle. (Added
             in 7.8.1)

     <B>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST</B>
             Pass a long. Set if we should verify the Common name
             from  the peer certificate in the SSL handshake, set
             1 to check existence, 2 to ensure  that  it  matches
             the provided hostname. (Added in 7.8.1)

     <B>CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR</B>
             Pass  a  file  name as char *, zero terminated. This
             will make libcurl dump all internally known  cookies
             to  the  specified file when <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>cleanup(3)</I> is
             called. If no cookies are known,  no  file  will  be
             created.  Specify  "-"  to  instead have the cookies
             written to stdout.

     <B>CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</B>
             Pass a char *, pointing to a zero terminated  string
             holding  the list of ciphers to use for the SSL con­
             nection. The list must be syntactly correct, it con­
             sists  of  one  or  more cipher strings separated by
             colons. Commas or spaces are also acceptable separa­
             tors  but colons are normally used, , - and + can be
             used as operators. Valid examples  of  cipher  lists
             include    'RC4-SHA',    ´SHA1+DES´,   'TLSv1'   and
             'DEFAULT'. The default list is normally set when you
             compile OpenSSL.

             You'll  find more details about cipher lists on this
             URL: <I>http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</I>

     <B>CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION</B>
             Pass a long, set to  one  of  the  values  described
             below.  They  force libcurl to use the specific HTTP
             versions. This is not sensible to do unless you have
             a good reason.

             <B>CURL_HTTP_VERSION_NONE</B>
                  We  don't  care  about what version the library
                  uses. libcurl will use whatever it thinks  fit.

             <B>CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_0</B>
                  Enforce HTTP 1.0 requests.

             <B>CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1</B>
                  Enforce HTTP 1.1 requests.

     <B>CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV</B>
             Pass a long. If the value is non-zero, it tells curl
             to use the EPSV command when doing passive FTP down­
             loads  (which is always does by default). Using EPSV
             means that it will first attempt to use EPSV  before
             using  PASV,  but  if  you pass FALSE (zero) to this
             option, it will not try using EPSV, only plain PASV.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
     CURLE_OK (zero) means that the option was set properly, non-
     zero means an error occurred as <I>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</I> defines.
