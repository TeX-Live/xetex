<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     libcurl - client-side URL transfers


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     This  is  an  overview  on how to use libcurl in your C pro­
     grams. There are specific man pages for each  function  men­
     tioned  in here. There's also the libcurl-the-guide document
     for a complete tutorial to programming with libcurl.

     libcurl can also be used directly  from  within  your  Java,
     PHP,  Perl, Ruby or Tcl programs as well, look elsewhere for
     documentation on this!

     All   applications   that   use    libcurl    should    call
     <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>global</I><B>_</B><I>init()</I>  exactly once before any libcurl function
     can be used. After all usage of libcurl is complete, it <B>must</B>
     call  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>global</I><B>_</B><I>cleanup()</I>. In between those two calls, you
     can use libcurl as described below.

     When using libcurl you init your session and get  a  handle,
     which  you use as input to the following interface functions
     you use. Use <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>init()</I> to get the handle.

     You continue by setting all the  options  you  want  in  the
     upcoming  transfer,  most  important  among  them is the URL
     itself (you can't transfer anything without a specified  URL
     as you may have figured out yourself). You might want to set
     some callbacks as well that will be called from the  library
     when data is available etc.  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>setopt()</I> is there for
     this.

     When all is setup, you tell libcurl to perform the  transfer
     using <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>perform()</I>.  It will then do the entire oper­
     ation and won't return until it  is  done  (successfully  or
     not).

     After  the  transfer  has been made, you can set new options
     and make another transfer, or if you're  done,  cleanup  the
     session by calling <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>cleanup()</I>.  If you want persis­
     tant connections, you don't cleanup immediately, but instead
     run ahead and perform other transfers using the same handle.
     See the chapter below for Persistant Connections.

     There is also a series of other helpful  functions  to  use.
     They are:


          <B>curl_version()</B>
                    displays the libcurl version

          <B>curl_getdate()</B>
                    converts a date string to time_t

          <B>curl_getenv()</B>
                    portable environment variable reader

          <B>curl_easy_getinfo()</B>
                    get information about a performed transfer

          <B>curl_formadd()</B>
                    helps building a HTTP form POST

          <B>curl_formfree()</B>
                    free    a    list   built   with   curl_form­
                    parse()/curl_formadd()

          <B>curl_slist_append()</B>
                    builds a linked list

          <B>curl_slist_free_all()</B>
                    frees a whole curl_slist

          <B>curl_mprintf()</B>
                    portable printf() functions

          <B>curl_strequal()</B>
                    portable case insensitive string comparisons

<H2>LINKING WITH LIBCURL</H2><PRE>
     Starting with 7.7.2 (on unix-like machines), there's a  tool
     named  curl-config  that gets installed with the rest of the
     curl stuff when 'make install' is performed.

     curl-config is added to make it easier for  applications  to
     link  with libcurl and developers to learn about libcurl and
     how to use it.

     Run 'curl-config --libs'  to  get  the  (additional)  linker
     options  you  need  to  link  with the particular version of
     libcurl you've installed.

     For details, see the curl-config.1 man page.


</PRE>
<H2>LIBCURL SYMBOL NAMES</H2><PRE>
     All public functions in the libcurl interface  are  prefixed
     with  'curl_' (with a lowercase c). You can find other func­
     tions in the library source code, but other  prefixes  indi­
     cate  the  functions are private and may change without fur­
     ther notice in the next release.

     Only use documented functions and functionality!


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
     libcurl works <B>exactly</B> the same, on any of the  platforms  it
     compiles and builds on.

     There's  only  one  caution,  and that is the win32 platform
     that may(*) require you to init the winsock stuff before you
     use  the libcurl functions. Details on this are noted on the
     curl_easy_init() man page.

     (*) = it appears as if users of the cygwin  environment  get
     this  done  automatically,  also libcurl 7.8.1 and later can
     handle this for you.


</PRE>
<H2>THREADS</H2><PRE>
     Never ever call curl-functions simultaneously using the same
     handle  from several threads. libcurl is thread-safe and can
     be used in any number of threads, but you must use  separate
     curl  handles  if  you  want to use libcurl in more than one
     thread simultaneously.


</PRE>
<H2>PERSISTANT CONNECTIONS</H2><PRE>
     With libcurl 7.7, persistant connections were added. Persis­
     tant connections means that libcurl can re-use the same con­
     nection for several transfers, if the conditions are  right.

     libcurl will *always* attempt to use persistant connections.
     Whenever you use curl_easy_perform(), libcurl  will  attempt
     to  use  an  existing  connection to do the transfer, and if
     none exists it'll open a new one that will  be  subject  for
     re-use  on a possible following call to curl_easy_perform().

     To allow libcurl to take full advantage of  persistant  con­
     nections,  you  should  do as many of your file transfers as
     possible  using  the  same  curl  handle.  When   you   call
     curl_easy_cleanup(),  all the possibly open connections held
     by libcurl will be closed and forgotten.

     Note that the options set with  curl_easy_setopt()  will  be
     used in on every repeat curl_easy_perform() call


</PRE>
<H2>COMPATIBILITY WITH OLDER LIBCURLS</H2><PRE>
     Repeated  curl_easy_perform()  calls on the same handle were
     not supported in pre-7.7 versions, and caused confusion  and
     undefined behaviour.
