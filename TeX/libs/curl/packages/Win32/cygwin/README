Curl is a tool for transferring files with URL syntax, supporting 
  FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, GOPHER, TELNET, DICT, FILE and LDAP.
  Curl supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, 
  FTP uploading, kerberos, HTTP form based upload, proxies, 
  cookies, user+password authentication, file transfer resume,
  http proxy tunneling and a busload of other useful tricks.

See /usr/doc/curl-<version>/FEATURES for more info.


Dependencies:
  - Cygwin
  - OpenSSL 0.9.6b-2+ (*)
  (*) cURL can be built without SSL support:  ./configure --without-ssl


Canonical Homepage and Downloads:
  http://curl.haxx.se/
  http://curl.haxx.se/download.html


Cygwin specific source files (a .README template and a Makefile
  for building binary tarballs) are maintained in the upstream
  CVS at: <srctop>/packages/Win32/cygwin/


Build Instructions (as distributed via cygwin's setup.exe):
  (NOTE: as of curl 7.9.1, compiles/tests 100% cleanly OOTB under cygwin)

  Download the source, unpack it to a location of your choosing, and then:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr 
  $ make
  $ make test    # optional, requires perl
  $ make install # (*)

  (*) LibTool 1.4.2 had a bug related to cygwin's use of ".exe" extensions,
      such that "make install" blew up at curl.exe. See this URL for details:
        http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/libtool/2001-September/005549.html
      The copy of ltmain.sh that is distributed with cURL includes this patch.


Packaging Instructions:
  ---BINARY---
  Compile cleanly (./configure + make). Then:

  $ make cygwinbin CYGBUILD=n

  where n is the cygwin release number (e.g. the "1" in curl-7.9-1).
  If you leave off "CYGBUILD=n", n defaults to 1.
  
  Assuming everything worked properly, you'll find your binary tarball
  in the packages/Win32/cygwin/ sub-directory.

  ---SOURCE---
  1. unpack the pristine source into an otherwise empty directory
  2. rename the source dir to add the "-$(REL)" suffix, e.g.:
     $ mv curl-7.9 curl-7.9-1
  3. add a CYGWIN-PATCHES directory, and add this readme to it
     $ cd curl-7.9-$(REL); mkdir CYGWIN-PATCHES
     $ cp packages/Win32/cygwin/README CYGWIN-PATCHES/curl-7.9-$(REL).README
  4. if applicable, document any changes in the README file
  5. create a patch which, when applied (patch -p1 < curl-7.9-$(REL).patch) 
     will remove any patches you've applied:
     $ cd ..
     $ diff -Nrup (patched-src-dir) (pristine-src-dir) > curl-7.9-$(REL).patch
     and then move it into the CYGWIN-PATCHES directory
  6. repack
