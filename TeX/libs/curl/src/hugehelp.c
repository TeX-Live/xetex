"NAME\n"
"     curl - transfer a URL\n"
"\n"
"SYNOPSIS\n"
"     curl [options] [URL...]\n"
"\n"
"DESCRIPTION\n"
"     curl  is  a client to get documents/files from or send docu­\n"
"     ments to a server, using  any  of  the  supported  protocols\n"
);
 puts(
"     (HTTP,  HTTPS, FTP, GOPHER, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). The\n"
"     command is designed to work without user interaction or  any\n"
"     kind of interactivity.\n"
"\n"
"     curl  offers  a busload of useful tricks like proxy support,\n"
"     user authentication, ftp upload,  HTTP  post,  SSL  (https:)\n"
"     connections, cookies, file transfer resume and more.\n"
"\n"
"URL\n"
"     The URL syntax is protocol dependent. You'll find a detailed\n"
"     description in RFC 2396.\n"
"\n"
);
 puts(
"     You can specify multiple URLs or parts of  URLs  by  writing\n"
"     part sets within braces as in:\n"
"\n"
"      http://site.{one,two,three}.com\n"
"\n"
"     or  you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using []\n"
"     as in:\n"
"\n"
"      ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt\n"
"      ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading\n"
"     zeros)\n"
"      ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt\n"
"\n"
"     It  is possible to specify up to 9 sets or series for a URL,\n"

"\n"
"      http://www.any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol­\n"
"     ume[1-4]part{a,b,c,index}.html\n"
"\n"
"     You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They\n"
"     will be fetched in a  sequential  manner  in  the  specified\n"
"     order.\n"
"\n"
"     Curl  will  attempt  to re-use connections for multiple file\n"
"     transfers, so that getting many files from the  same  server\n"
"     will  not  do  multiple connects / handshakes. This improves\n"
);

"COOKIES\n"
"\n"
"  Cookies are generally used by web servers to keep state information at the\n"
"  client's side. The server sets cookies by sending a response line in the\n"
"  headers that looks like 'Set-Cookie: <data>' where the data part then\n"
"  typically contains a set of NAME=VALUE pairs (separated by semicolons ';'\n"
);

"  path the \"cookie\" should be used for (by specifying \"path=value\"), when the\n"
"  cookie should expire (\"expire=DATE\"), for what domain to use it\n"
"  (\"domain=NAME\") and if it should be used on secure connections only\n"
"  (\"secure\").\n"
"\n"
"  If you've received a page from a server that contains a header like:\n"
"        Set-Cookie: sessionid=boo123; path=\"/foo\";\n"
"\n"
);
 puts(
"  it means the server wants that first pair passed on when we get anything in\n"
"  a path beginning with \"/foo\".\n"
"\n"
"  Example, get a page that wants my name passed in a cookie:\n"
"\n"
"        curl -b \"name=Daniel\" www.sillypage.com\n"
"\n"
"  Curl also has the ability to use previously received cookies in following\n"
"  sessions. If you get cookies from a server and store them in a file in a\n"
"  manner similar to:\n"
"\n"
"        curl --dump-header headers www.example.com\n"
"\n"
);
 puts(
"  ... you can then in a second connect to that (or another) site, use the\n"
"  cookies from the 'headers' file like:\n"
"\n"
"        curl -b headers www.example.com\n"
"\n"
"  Note that by specifying -b you enable the \"cookie awareness\" and with -L\n"
"  you can make curl follow a location: (which often is used in combination\n"
"  with cookies). So that if a site sends cookies and a location, you can\n"
"  use a non-existing file to trigger the cookie awareness like:\n"
"\n"
"        curl -L -b empty.txt www.example.com\n"
"\n"
);
 puts(
"  The file to read cookies from must be formatted using plain HTTP headers OR\n"
"  as netscape's cookie file. Curl will determine what kind it is based on the\n"
"  file contents.  In the above command, curl will parse the header and store\n"
"  the cookies received from www.example.com.  curl will send to the server the\n"
"  stored cookies which match the request as it follows the location.  The\n"

"\n"
"  The config file could be made up with normal command line switches, but you\n"
"  can also specify the long options without the dashes to make it more\n"
"  readable. You can separate the options and the parameter with spaces, or\n"
"  with = or :. Comments can be used within the file. If the first letter on a\n"
);

"  If you want the parameter to contain spaces, you must inclose the entire\n"
"  parameter within double quotes (\"). Within those quotes, you specify a\n"
"  quote as \\\".\n"
"\n"
"  NOTE: You must specify options and their arguments on the same line.\n"
"\n"
"  Example, set default time out and proxy in a config file:\n"
"\n"
"        # We want a 30 minute timeout:\n"
"        -m 1800\n"
"        # ... and we use a proxy for all accesses:\n"
);
 puts(
"        proxy = proxy.our.domain.com:8080\n"
"\n"
"  White spaces ARE significant at the end of lines, but all white spaces\n"
"  leading up to the first characters of each line are ignored.\n"
"\n"
"  Prevent curl from reading the default file by using -q as the first command\n"
"  line parameter, like:\n"
"\n"
"        curl -q www.thatsite.com\n"
"\n"
"  Force curl to get and display a local help page in case it is invoked\n"

"        # default url to get\n"
);
 puts(
"        url = \"http://help.with.curl.com/curlhelp.html\"\n"
"\n"
"  You can specify another config file to be read by using the -K/--config\n"
"  flag. If you set config file name to \"-\" it'll read the config from stdin,\n"
"  which can be handy if you want to hide options from being visible in process\n"
"  tables etc:\n"
"\n"
"        echo \"user = user:passwd\" | curl -K - http://that.secret.site.com\n"
"\n"
"EXTRA HEADERS\n"
"\n"
"  When using curl in your own very special programs, you may end up needing\n"
);
 puts(
"  to pass on your own custom headers when getting a web page. You can do\n"
"  this by using the -H flag.\n"
"\n"
"  Example, send the header \"X-you-and-me: yes\" to the server when getting a\n"
"  page:\n"
"\n"
"        curl -H \"X-you-and-me: yes\" www.love.com\n"
"\n"
"  This can also be useful in case you want curl to send a different text in a\n"
"  header than it normally does. The -H header you specify then replaces the\n"
"  header curl would normally send. If you replace an internal header with an\n"
);
 puts(
"  empty one, you prevent that header from being sent. To prevent the Host:\n"

"FTP and PATH NAMES\n"

"\n"
"  (I.e with an extra slash in front of the file name.)\n"
"\n"
"FTP and firewalls\n"
"\n"
"  The FTP protocol requires one of the involved parties to open a second\n"
"  connction as soon as data is about to get transfered. There are two ways to\n"
"  do this.\n"
"\n"
"  The default way for curl is to issue the PASV command which causes the\n"
"  server to open another port and await another connection performed by the\n"

"  incoming connections.\n"

"  If the server for example, is behind a firewall that don't allow connections\n"
"  on other ports than 21 (or if it just doesn't support the PASV command), the\n"
"  other way to do it is to use the PORT command and instruct the server to\n"
"  connect to the client on the given (as parameters to the PORT command) IP\n"
"  number and port.\n"
"\n"
);
 puts(
"  The -P flag to curl supports a few different options. Your machine may have\n"

"ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\n"
"\n"
"  Curl reads and understands the following environment variables:\n"
"\n"
"        HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, FTP_PROXY, GOPHER_PROXY\n"
"\n"
"  They should be set for protocol-specific proxies. General proxy should be\n"
"  set with\n"
"        \n"
"        ALL_PROXY\n"
"\n"
);
 puts(
"  A comma-separated list of host names that shouldn't go through any proxy is\n"
"  set in (only an asterisk, '*' matches all hosts)\n"
"\n"
"        NO_PROXY\n"
"\n"
"  If a tail substring of the domain-path for a host matches one of these\n"
"  strings, transactions with that node will not be proxied.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"  The usage of the -x/--proxy flag overrides the environment variables.\n"
"\n"
"NETRC\n"
"\n"
"  Unix introduced the .netrc concept a long time ago. It is a way for a user\n"
);
 puts(
"  to specify name and password for commonly visited ftp sites in a file so\n"
"  that you don't have to type them in each time you visit those sites. You\n"
"  realize this is a big security risk if someone else gets hold of your\n"
"  passwords, so therefor most unix programs won't read this file unless it is\n"
"  only readable by yourself (curl doesn't care though).\n"
"\n"
"  Curl supports .netrc files if told so (using the -n/--netrc option). This is\n"
);
 puts(
"  not restricted to only ftp, but curl can use it for all protocols where\n"
"  authentication is used.\n"
"\n"
"  A very simple .netrc file could look something like:\n"
"\n"
"        machine curl.haxx.se login iamdaniel password mysecret\n"
"\n"
"CUSTOM OUTPUT\n"
"\n"
"  To better allow script programmers to get to know about the progress of\n"
"  curl, the -w/--write-out option was introduced. Using this, you can specify\n"
"  what information from the previous transfer you want to extract.\n"
"\n"
);
 puts(
"  To display the amount of bytes downloaded together with some text and an\n"
"  ending newline:\n"
"\n"
"        curl -w 'We downloaded %{size_download} bytes\\n' www.download.com\n"
"\n"
"KERBEROS4 FTP TRANSFER\n"
"\n"
"  Curl supports kerberos4 for FTP transfers. You need the kerberos package\n"
"  installed and used at curl build time for it to be used.\n"
"\n"
"  First, get the krb-ticket the normal way, like with the kauth tool. Then use\n"
"  curl in way similar to:\n"
"\n"
);
 puts(
"        curl --krb4 private ftp://krb4site.com -u username:fakepwd\n"
"\n"
"  There's no use for a password on the -u switch, but a blank one will make\n"
"  curl ask for one and you already entered the real password to kauth.\n"
"\n"
"TELNET\n"
"\n"
"  The curl telnet support is basic and very easy to use. Curl passes all data\n"
"  passed to it on stdin to the remote server. Connect to a remote telnet\n"
"  server using a command line similar to:\n"
"\n"
"        curl telnet://remote.server.com\n"
"\n"
);
 puts(
"  And enter the data to pass to the server on stdin. The result will be sent\n"
"  to stdout or to the file you specify with -o.\n"
"\n"
"  You might want the -N/--no-buffer option to switch off the buffered output\n"
"  for slow connections or similar.\n"
"\n"
"  Pass options to the telnet protocol negotiation, by using the -t option. To\n"
"  tell the server we use a vt100 terminal, try something like:\n"
"\n"
"        curl -tTTYPE=vt100 telnet://remote.server.com\n"
"\n"
"  Other interesting options for it -t include:\n"
"\n"
);
 puts(
"   - XDISPLOC=<X display> Sets the X display location.\n"
"\n"
"   - NEW_ENV=<var,val> Sets an environment variable.\n"
"\n"
"  NOTE: the telnet protocol does not specify any way to login with a specified\n"
"  user and password so curl can't do that automatically. To do that, you need\n"
"  to track when the login prompt is received and send the username and\n"
"  password accordingly.\n"
"\n"
"PERSISTANT CONNECTIONS\n"
"\n"
"  Specifying multiple files on a single command line will make curl transfer\n"
);
 puts(
"  all of them, one after the other in the specified order.\n"
"\n"
"  libcurl will attempt to use persistant connections for the transfers so that\n"
"  the second transfer to the same host can use the same connection that was\n"
"  already initiated and was left open in the previous transfer. This greatly\n"
"  decreases connection time for all but the first transfer and it makes a far\n"
"  better use of the network.\n"
"\n"
"  Note that curl cannot use persistant connections for transfers that are used\n"
);
 puts(
"  in subsequence curl invokes. Try to stuff as many URLs as possible on the\n"
"  same command line if they are using the same host, as that'll make the\n"
"  transfers faster. If you use a http proxy for file transfers, practicly\n"
"  all transfers will be persistant.\n"
"\n"
"  Persistant connections were introduced in curl 7.7.\n"
