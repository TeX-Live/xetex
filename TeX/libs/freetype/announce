                   The FREE TrueType Font Engine


       Copyright (C) 1996-2001 The FreeType Development Team



  The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering
  engine, available in  ANSI C and Pascal source  code.  It has been
  developed  to  provide TrueType  support  to  a  great variety  of
  platforms and environments.
  
  Notice that  FreeType is a *library*.   It is *not*  a font server
  for your  preferred environment, even though it  has been designed
  to  be the  basis of  many  high-level libraries,  tools and  font
  servers.

  It's  a clean-room  implementation that  is not  derived  from the
  original TrueType engine developed  by Apple and Microsoft, though
  it matches it regarding rendering quality.  To our knowledge, it's
  the only royalty-free complete TrueType engine available.

  Some news:

  . version 1.5 fixes minor bugs found in 1.3.1.
  . version 1.4 were never released officially (by us).
  . full support for GSUB and GPOS tables in OpenType fonts.
  . enhanced ftdump/ftstrtto test programs using GPOS support.
  . ftstrpnm supports coloured text.
  . TT_Char_Index() now uses a TT_ULong for char codes.
  . support files for BeOS.
  . the  Pascal version  is no  longer part  of the  package  but is
    available separately.
  . uses a new version of libtool, solving some compilation problems
    with the test programs on some platforms like Solaris.
