Dear Folks,

this directory basically contains the Type 1 rasterizer code, donated
to the X11-project by IBM and afterwards modified by Piet Tutelaers
for his ps2pk-package. But there are several files modified by
myself. Thus the state of this directory is not an official one and
subject to further changes!

Before version 0.6 of t1lib I have cleaned the sources, removed the X11-dummy
function and made the sources more ANSI-C compliant.
