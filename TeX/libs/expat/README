			Expat, Release 1.95.1

This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark. Expat
is a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with
the parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are called when
the parser discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed.
A start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
register handlers.

Expat is free software. You may copy, distribute, and modify it under the
terms of the License contained in the file, COPYING, distributed with this
package. This license is the same as the MIT/X Consortium license.

Versions of expat that have an odd minor version (the middle number in the
release above), are development releases and should be considered as
beta software. Releases with even minor version numbers are intended to be
production grade software.

To build expat, you first run the configuration shell script in the top
level distribution directory:

	./configure

There are many options which you may provide to configure (which you can
discover by running configure with the --help option.) But the one of most
interest is the one that sets the installation directory. By default,
the configure script will set things up to install libexpat into
/usr/local/lib and expat.h into /usr/local/include. If, for example, you'd
prefer to install into /home/me/mystuff/lib and /home/me/mystuff/include,
you can tell configure about that with:

	./configure --prefix=/home/me/mystuff

After running the configure script, the "make" command will build things and
"make install" will install things into their proper location. Note that
you need to have write permission into the directories into which things
will be installed.

Alternatively, on Win32 systems with Microsoft's Developer's Studio installed,
you can simply double-click on lib/expat.dsp from Windows Explorer and build
and install in the usual way from with DevStudio.

As a third alternative you may choose to download expat_win32bin which has
a pre-compiled dll in it.

A reference manual is available in the doc/reference.html in this
distribution.
