# A list of txt's to build
# Note: 
#
#   If you are thinking of modifying this file, READ THIS. 
#
# Instead of changing this file [unless you want to check it back in],
# you should consider creating a 'collocal.mk' file in this same directory.
# Then, you can have your local changes remain even if you upgrade or
# reconfigure ICU.
#
# Example 'collocal.mk' files:
#
#  * To add an additional locale to the list: 
#    _____________________________________________________
#    |  COLLATION_SOURCE_LOCAL =   myLocale.txt ...
#
#  * To REPLACE the default list and only build with a few
#     locale:
#    _____________________________________________________
#    |  COLLATION_SOURCE = ar.txt ar_AE.txt en.txt de.txt zh.txt
#
#
# Generated by LDML2ICUConverter, from LDML source files. 

# Aliases which do not have a corresponding xx.xml file (see deprecatedList.xml)
COLLATION_SYNTHETIC_ALIAS = 


# All aliases (to not be included under 'installed'), but not including root.
COLLATION_ALIAS_SOURCE = $(COLLATION_SYNTHETIC_ALIAS)


# Empty locales, used for validSubLocale fallback.
COLLATION_EMPTY_SOURCE = 


# Ordinary resources
COLLATION_SOURCE = $(COLLATION_EMPTY_SOURCE) \
	en.txt # not needed for xetex, but MinGW can't handle empty list
