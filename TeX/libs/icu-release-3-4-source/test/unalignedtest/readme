Unalignedtest
=============

This is a test to find if ICU is 64 bit clean. This test runs cintltst and intltest through gdb and produces SIGBUS fault
whenever the kernel encounters a unaligned trap. 

Build and Usage
==================
To build this test:

i)   Build and test ICU

ii)  cd to <icu>/source and run the following command to build the Makefile
CONFIG_FILES=./test/unalignedtest/Makefile CONFIG_HEADERS= ./config.status

iii) cd to <icu>/source/test/unalignedtest and run 'make' to build the executable

iv) For testing cintltst run 'make check-cintltst'

v) For testing intltest run 'make check-intltest'

vi) To find out if any of the tools are performing unaligned traps:
	a) cd to <icu>/source/data
	b) run 'make clean'
	c) run 'env LEAK_CHECKER="<icu>/source/test/unalignedtest/unalignedtest -b" make'
