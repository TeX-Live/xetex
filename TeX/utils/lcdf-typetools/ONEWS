Mminstance NEWS

This file contains news relevant to the mmafm and mmpfb programs, which
used to be distributed separately in the mminstance package.

Version 1.50   20.Aug.2003

* As of version 1.50, mminstance is distributed as part of the
  lcdf-typetools package. Changes for versions 1.50 and up are listed in
  NEWS.


Version 1.26.3   14.Aug.2003

* Library changes to attempt to satisfy more C++ compilers. Again massive
  thanks to Nelson H.F. Beebe, and new massive thanks to Fabrice Popineau.


Version 1.26.2   13.Aug.2003

* Revert from '#include <cXXX>' to '#include <XXX.h>'.


Version 1.26.1   11.Aug.2003

* 'uintptr_t' configury, and more template changes.


Version 1.26   10.Aug.2003

* Further address build problems reported by Nelson Beebe.


Version 1.25   7.Aug.2003

* Address build problems reported by Nelson H.F. Beebe.


Version 1.24   30.Jul.2003

* Fix configure check for whether va_list is addressable. Ryan Murray found
  the bug; thanks hugely to Claire Connelly for testing resources.

* Minor code restructuring.

* mmpfb: --minimize is the default.

* mmpfb: --minimize additionally forces some interpolated values to
  integers, specifically BlueValues, OtherBlues, FamilyBlues,
  FamilyOtherBlues, and BlueShift. Maybe this will avoid some problems
  people have had with embedding mmpfb-generated fonts and Acrobat 6.

* Change rounding procedures. Now fonts generated on different platforms
  will likely not differ in rounding details. (What a difference 0.00001
  makes!)


Version 1.23   9.Jul.2003

* Add configure check for whether va_list is addressable. Thanks to Claire
  Connelly.


Version 1.22   5.Jun.2003

* More template nonsense. Mea culpa to Melissa O'Neill and Claire Connelly.


Version 1.21   4.Jun.2003

* GCC 3.3 would not link mminstance due to missing template instantiations.
  Moved templatei.cc into libefont.a to fix this. Reported by Melissa
  O'Neill <oneill@cs.hmc.edu>.


Version 1.20   26.Jan.2003

* mmafm: Fix bug with parsing intermediate-master files that made AJensonMM
  unusable. Reported by Fulko van Westrenen <westrenen@fvw.cistron.nl>.


Version 1.19   5.Jan.2003

* mmpfb: Previously, error introduced by the rounding process could build
  up over the length of a path, causing an anomaly when the path was
  closed. Now mmpfb compensates for rounding error, resulting in a path
  with better fidelity.

* mmpfb: Add the `--minimize' option to minimize output fonts, allowing the
  X font server to load mmpfb-generated fonts. Problem with the X font
  server reported by Joerg Lippman <joerg.lippmann@o3-software.de>.

* mmpfb: Add placeholder subroutines to fill in any gaps in the subroutine
  array, which the X font server doesn't like (that IBM Type 1 code is
  bad!). Probably this should be optional, since it makes the font bigger.

* mmpfb: Renumber subroutines consecutively.

* mmpfb: Generate a new FullName as well as a new FontName.

* Adapt to newer Automake and LCDF and Efont libraries.


Version 1.18   5.Oct.2002

* Fix for compilation with newer C++ compilers.


Version 1.17   30.Sep.2002

* Fix for NuevaMM-It: the ItalicAngle array was not being properly
  commented out. Reported by Thomas Wu <twu@gene.com>.


Version 1.16.3   17.Sep.2001

* Workaround for Mac OS X: its sscanf() function behaves incorrectly when a
  format string ends with ` %n'. Reported and patched by Melissa O'Neill
  <oneill@cs.sfu.ca>.


Version 1.16.2   6.Sep.2001

* Improvements so mminstance compiles on more platforms. Problems reported
  by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu>.


Version 1.16.1   15.Jul.2001

* Bug fix: more cleanups for newer GCCs. Reported by C. M. Connelly
  <c@eskimo.com>.


Version 1.16   18.Jun.2001

* Bug fix: now newer C++ compilers will compile mminstance. Reported by
  Melissa O'Neill <oneill@cs.sfu.ca>.


Version 1.15.1   12.Aug.2000

* Don't use `-Wall' by default; old C++ compilers generate huge numbers of
  irrelevant warnings. Reported by Tom Kacvinsky <tjk@ams.org>.


Version 1.15   12.Jul.2000

* mmpfb: Remove calls to nonexistent subroutines. (This was not actually a
  bug; the calls to nonexistent subroutines would never execute anyway. The
  font ITCGaramondMM-It had characters like `/question { A callsubr B
  callsubr }', where the `A' subroutine would either draw an entire
  character and call `endchar' -- so `B' would never get called -- or it
  would do nothing at all. Previous mmpfb versions would remove the `B'
  subroutine but keep the `B callsubr' call if the interpolated `A' called
  `endchar'.) Requested by Han The Thanh <thanh@informatics.muni.cz>.

* mmpfb: Removed warning about `strange othersubr commands'.


Version 1.14   22.Jun.2000

* mmpfb: Fixed a bug with large UniqueID values. Reported by Sivan Toledo
  <sivan@math.tau.ac.il>.

* mmpfb: Support for interpolating BlueFuzz without any warnings.


Version 1.13   16.Apr.2000

* mmpfb: Can handle synthetic fonts like TektonMM-Oblique. Requested by
  Melissa O'Neill <oneill@cs.sfu.ca>.


Version 1.12   5.Apr.2000

* mmpfb: Make sure to remove multiple master commands from hint replacement
  subroutines. Required another overhaul. Requested by Han The Thanh
  <thanh@informatics.muni.cz>.


Version 1.11   3.Apr.2000

* mmafm: Added `--kern-precision' option. Requested by Han The Thanh
  <thanh@informatics.muni.cz>.

* Bug fix: now mminstance can be compiled with recent versions of gcc. The
  error was a strange use of va_arg(). Reported by C. M. Connelly
  <c@eskimo.com>.


Version 1.10   21.Feb.2000

* mmpfb: Comment out DesignVector, NormDesignVector, and WeightVector
  entries. Now Ghostscript 6.0's ps2pdf script will work with
  mmpfb-generated fonts. Change requested by Melissa O'Neill
  <oneill@cs.sfu.ca>.


Version 1.9   18.Jan.2000

* mmpfb: Bug fix in special callothersubrs code introduced in Version 1.8.
  This bug probably did not affect anyone.


Version 1.8   10.Jan.2000

* mmpfb: Don't warn when encountering `BuildCharArray'. This shows up in
  some ITC multiple masters. Requested by Han The Thanh
  <thanh@informatics.muni.cz>.

* mmpfb: Handle special callothersubrs from ITC Garamond MM. This required
  big changes, but the code is cleaner now, and more likely to be right in
  future: best of both worlds. Requested by Han The Thanh
  <thanh@informatics.muni.cz>.


Version 1.7   30.Dec.1999

* mmpfb: Fixed bug where garbled encoding vectors could be produced.
  Patch sent in by Christopher League <league@contrapunctus.net>.

* Bug fix: Some error messages used to cause assertion failures.


Version 1.6   28.Nov.1999

* mmafm: Added `--precision' option for optionally rounding AFM dimensions.
  Requested by Christopher League <league@contrapunctus.net>.

* Many bug fixes for compiling under NeXTSTEP or g++ 2.95. Patches sent in
  by Melissa O'Neill <oneill@cs.sfu.ca>.

* Bug fix: numbers with both decimal point and exponent, like `1.2e5', are
  parsed correctly.


Version 1.5   4.Jul.1999

* mmpfb: Added `--subrs' option for reducing the number of subroutines in
  the output font. Use this option if you plan to use Acrobat Distiller 3.0
  to distill PostScript files including mmpfb-generated fonts. Distiller
  3.0 has a low limit on the number of subroutines per font. Several
  changes to the Type 1 library support this. Problem reported by Thierry
  Bouche <Thierry.Bouche@ujf-grenoble.fr>; tracking help by Tom Kacvinsky
  <tjk@ams.org>.

* Both programs accept multiple master instance names, like
  `MinionMM_367_400_18_', and will interpolate that instance from the
  multiple master font.

* Removed `FONTPATH' and `AFMPATH'. `PSRESOURCEPATH' has been preferred for
  a couple months.

* Updated ErrorHandler.


Version 1.4.1   26.Jun.1999

* mmpfb: Also comment out the /UniqueID in the Private dictionary, if any.
  Reported by Thierry Bouche <Thierry.Bouche@ujf-grenoble.fr>.


Version 1.4   25.Jun.1999

* mmpfb: Always comment out any /UniqueID in the font. This bug prevented
  some printers from printing files with mmpfb-interpolated fonts. Reported
  by Thierry Bouche <Thierry.Bouche@ujf-grenoble.fr>.

* mmpfb: Comment out `Blend...' entries in the FontInfo dictionary. Now
  Adobe Acrobat Distiller can handle mmpfb-interpolated fonts; it correctly
  treats them like single-master fonts. Problem reported by Thierry Bouche
  <Thierry.Bouche@ujf-grenoble.fr>.

* mmpfb: Comment out multiple-master-specific dictionary entries, rather
  than removing them entirely.

* mmpfb: Interpolates Blend FontInfo dictionary entries, like
  `UnderlinePosition' (maybe; can't find any fonts that use them, so it's
  untested).


Version 1.3.1   21.May.1999

* Changed libraries to conform to STL interfaces.

* Change to psres.cc to fix compilation bug under old C++ compilers.


Version 1.3   11.Apr.1999

* Mmafm will now automatically run `mmpfb --amcp-info' when necessary, so
  you don't have to create the AMCP files yourself. Caveat: This will only
  work if you use the PSRESOURCEPATH environment variable and have
  PSres.upr files set up correctly.

* mmafm: Added the PSRESOURCEPATH environment variable, in favor of
  AFMPATH and FONTPATH.

* mmafm: Checks for completely unknown design vectors.

* mmpfb: Now uses the PSRESOURCEPATH environment variable to look for fonts
  by name.

* mmpfb: Modifies the output font's XUID to prevent font cache pollution.

* Improved documentation.

* Unfortunately, this version still doesn't work under NeXTSTEP.


Version 1.3b2   22.Jan.1999

* Don't use `index' as a method name; it's a macro under NeXTSTEP. Reported
  by Melissa O'Neill <oneill@cs.sfu.ca>.

* Patch around problems with NeXTSTEP's strtod and strtol. Also reported by
  Melissa O'Neill <oneill@cs.sfu.ca>.


Version 1.3b1   12.Jan.1999

* Han The Thanh <thanh@informatics.muni.cz> reports that Acrobat Reader
  gives a "bad /BBox" warning on mmpfb-interpolated fonts. This seems to be
  because mmpfb would produce fractional FontBBox entries. Fix: round the
  FontBBox entries so it contains integers.

* Small bug fix: negative non-integers were formerly read incorrectly,
  introducing an error of not more than 2 integer units.


Version 1.2   18.Dec.1998

* Better error messages and fewer coredumps on bad files.

* The mminstance package now uses automake.


Version 1.1   27.Sep.1998

* mmpfb: Changes to remove all multiple master commands in the output font,
  not just most of them.

* mmpfb: Added error message on bad input file.

* Removed hackery which prevented linking with -lstdc++.

* `--help' now prints on stdout, as the GNU standards require.

* Makefiles: added `make uninstall' target, enabled `./configure's program
  name transformations, made VPATH builds possible.


Version 1.0   17.Sep.1998

* No changes; just decided it was stable.


Version 0.92   2.Sep.1998

* Code reorganization in metrics. (Removed LineScanner, which wasn't a general
  design; split into a more general Slurper and a specific AfmParser.)


Version 0.91   15.May.1998

* mmafm: Nonexistent files caused a coredump instead of an error (fixed).

* mmafm: Added support for finding AMFMs via path variables and PSres.upr
  files (you don't have to give an AMFM filename on the command line, you can
  give a font name).


Version 0.9   4.Mar.1998

* Fixed a bug in parsing fonts with intermediate masters.

* mmafm: Added support for finding AFMs via path variables and PSres.upr
  files, and for giving their filenames on the command line.

* Wrote manual pages.


Version 0.8

* Major release: Mmafm uses a new AFM/AMFM parsing library.

* Restructured the two packages (mmafm and mmpfb) into one package
  (mminstance) containing both programs.

* Improved error messages, command line behavior, usage, and help.


Version 0.62

* Fixed small bug in t1interp.cc which caused serious problems. (Function
  Type1Interp::number() fell off the end instead of returning true.) Bug
  reported by Melissa O'Neill <oneill@cs.sfu.ca>.


Version 0.6

* Major release: Both programs use a new, modular Type 1 parsing library,
  they take real numbers as arguments, and the configure scripts no longer
  try to link with -lstdc++. Thanks to Melissa O'Neill <oneill@cs.sfu.ca>
  for suggestions.

* mmafm looks for separate .amcp files for intermediate master conversion
  programs. Suggested by Melissa O'Neill <oneill@cs.sfu.ca>.

* mmpfb can read and generate PFA fonts.

* Other fixes.


Version 0.5

* Fixed bug preventing the programs from working with Kepler.


Version 0.4

* Fixed mmpfb to handle older multiple master fonts (Myriad and Minion) and
  to generate non-truncated PFBs.


Version 0.2   16.Aug.1997

* Fixed serious bug in normalize_vector that resulted in incorrect output.


Version 0.1   21.Jul.1997

* Initial release.
