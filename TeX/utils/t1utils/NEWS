T1utils NEWS

Version 1.32   23.Feb.2004

* t1disasm: Avoid memory corruption bug (strings passed to eexec_line are
  not null terminated).  Reported by Werner Lemberg.


Version 1.31   8.Feb.2004

* All: Support fonts where the eexec-encrypted portion is binary, and the
  first ciphertext byte is 0.  Reported by Werner Lemberg.


Version 1.30   6.Jan.2004

* All: Support fonts, such as those in PostScript files printed by
  acroread, where "currentfile eexec" is not followed by a newline.


Version 1.29   6.Oct.2003

* t1disasm: Support odd fonts where a character is defined on the
  "/CharStrings" line. Reported by Werner Lemberg.


Version 1.28   7.Aug.2003

* Address build problems reported by Nelson H.F. Beebe.


Version 1.27   26.Mar.2003

* t1ascii: Add optional warning when output lines are longer than 255
  characters. Requested by Werner Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>.


Version 1.26   16.Apr.2002

* t1mac: Fix buglet (C++ comment, and temporary file left behind). Reported
  by Vladimir Volovich <vvv@vsu.ru>.


Version 1.25   3.Jan.2002

* t1asm: Beware extra characters after `currentfile closefile'. Reported by
  Luc Devroye <luc@cs.mcgill.ca>.


Version 1.24   6.Sep.2001

* Fixed compilation bugs on various platforms reported by Nelson H. F.
  Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu>.


Version 1.23   18.Jun.2001

* Fixed Macintosh file bugs: the MacBinary CRC was calculated incorrectly,
  and extended finder flags were set to random values in BinHex output.
  Reported, and patch provided, by Tom Kacvinsky <tjk@ams.org>.


Version 1.22   6.Mar.2001

* Fixed bug on processing PFA fonts with DOS line endings. The symptom was
  t1binary producing strange/unusable fonts. Problem: the all-zeros line,
  which signals the end of the font's binary section, was not being
  recognized because of an extra '\r'. This has been a bug since version
  1.13 -- chagrin! Problem reported by Han The Thanh
  <thanh@informatics.muni.cz>.


Version 1.21   9.Feb.2001

* t1ascii, t1asm, t1unmac: Raised minimum PFA line length to 8. The Adobe
  spec may imply that there cannot be whitespace within the first 8 bytes
  of an ASCII-encoded eexec section; it's somewhat ambiguous. Reported by
  Rainer Menzner <Rainer.Menzner@neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bochum.de>.


Version 1.20   22.Jun.2000

* t1asm: Fixed bug where `t1asm -a' would give a `warning: line length
  raised to 4' error message. Reported by Tom Kacvinsky <tjk@ams.org>.


Version 1.19   3.May.2000

* t1mac: Generated Macintosh fonts now use a custom-drawn icon set, rather
  than Adobe's default. They also have a t1utils-specific creator signature
  (T1UT), and their file information mentions t1utils.

* t1mac: Added the `--filename' option.


Version 1.18   2.May.2000

* t1mac: Fixed bug where generated files appeared corrupted to Macintoshes.
  Reported by Marten Thavenius <marten.thavenius@bahnhof.se>.


Version 1.17   27.Apr.2000

* Added new program, `t1mac', which translates PFA or PFB fonts into
  Macintosh-style fonts. T1mac can output in MacBinary, AppleSingle,
  AppleDouble, or BinHex format. Suggested by Marten Thavenius
  <marten.thavenius@bahnhof.se>.

* t1unmac: Added support for BinHex.

* t1unmac: Fixed bugs in manual page and program options.


Version 1.16   25.Apr.2000

* t1unmac: Supports AppleSingle and AppleDouble files with the
  `--applesingle/double' option. Requested by Kent Boortz
  <kent@erix.ericsson.se>.


Version 1.15   4.Apr.2000

* t1ascii, t1binary, and t1disasm: Fixed bad error message.

* t1unmac: Generates PFB fonts by default.


Version 1.14   25.Aug.1999

* t1asm: Version 1.13 produced complete crap output. My test cases were too
  limited to catch this. Found by Rainer Menzner
  <Rainer.Menzner@neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bochum.de>.


Version 1.13   2.Aug.1999

* t1disasm: Complete rewrite. It now uses t1lib.c functions; the goal is to
  handle PFA and PFB fonts consistently. This has been extensively tested,
  but there may be bugs.

* t1disasm, t1asm: Fixed to support fonts with multiple Subrs and
  CharStrings sections, like some old Oblique fonts.

* PFA minimum line length raised to 4.

* t1ascii, t1binary, t1disasm: Changes in t1lib.c to support reading binary
  PFA fonts. Requested by Tom Kacvinsky <tjk@ams.org>.


Version 1.12   1.Aug.1999

* t1ascii, t1binary, t1asm, t1disasm: Support fonts with whitespace
  following the "currentfile eexec" line. Embedded fonts in PostScript
  generated by Acrobat Reader have this property. Reported by Tom Kacvinsky
  <tjk@ams.org>.

* t1ascii, t1asm, t1unmac: Use lowercase hex digits instead of uppercase.

* t1unmac: Added `--line-length' option for PFA output.


Version 1.11   29.May.1999

* Bug fix in t1asm/t1disasm: if a `readhexstring' procedure was defined, we
  got confused. Reported by Luc Devroye <luc@CS.McGill.CA>.

* t1binary now has a maximum block length of 2^32 - 1. "Feature" requested
  by Werner Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>.

* t1ascii and t1binary each accept both PFA and PFB fonts. If you pass an
  ASCII font (PFA) to t1ascii, it will output it mostly unchanged, and
  similarly for PFB fonts and t1binary. The `-l' options will still take
  effect, so you can use `t1ascii -l 60' to shorten the encrypted line
  lengths of a PFA font. t1ascii also does some newline translation
  (changes carriage returns to newlines).


Version 1.10.1   12.Apr.1999

* t1asm: Fixed bug when `-l' option wasn't provided. Caught by Giuseppe
  Ghibò <ghibo@caesar.polito.it>.


Version 1.10   11.Apr.1999

* t1asm/t1disasm: Provide support for Type1C (Compact Font Format) font
  files. These fonts have unencrypted character strings, signalled by a
  negative lenIV value. Suggestion and patch thanks to Tom Kacvinsky
  <tjk@ams.org>.

* t1ascii/t1asm: Added `-l/--line-length' option to control maximum
  encrypted line length. Suggestion thanks to Giuseppe Ghibò
  <ghibo@caesar.polito.it>.


Version 1.9   14.Feb.1999

* t1asm/t1disasm: Be more robust on fonts that don't end in `mark
  currentfile closefile'. John Vromans <JVromans@squirrel.nl> provided a
  font that ended with `mark' on one line and `currentfile closefile' on
  another; t1asm and t1disasm did not recognize the encrypted section of
  the font had ended, and generated some garbage.


Version 1.8   2.Jan.1999

* Added some more Type 2 commands (flex, flex1, hflex, hflex1) from a
  revision of the Type 2 spec. (I wouldn't have known about this except for
  CurveSoft's revised t1utils package, available at
  http://www.curvesoft.com. These t1utils are more up-to-date than theirs,
  however.)

* t1asm: Fixed one Type 2 command's translation (cntrmask was incorrectly
  mapped to 18, not 20).


Version 1.7.2   11.Dec.1998

* Integrated patches from Jan-Jaap van der Heijden
  <J.J.vanderHeijden@student.utwente.nl> to support building t1utils under
  32-bit Windows.


Version 1.7.1   5.Dec.1998

* The t1utils package now uses automake.


Version 1.7   27.Nov.1998

* t1asm: Should now work with fonts that have no /Subrs sections. Previously,
  assembling such a font would silently fail; all the character definitions
  would be mistaken for procedures and t1asm wouldn't translate them. Problem
  noticed and fix suggested by Tom Kacvinsky <tjk@ams.org>.

* t1disasm: Removed spurious debugging output and improved warning message
  about unknown charstring commands.

* Changed fgetc/fputc into getc/putc.


Version 1.6   27.Sep.1998

* `--help' now prints to stdout, following the GNU Coding Standards.

* Makefiles: Added `make uninstall' target, enabled `./configure's
  program name transformations, made VPATH builds possible.


Version 1.5.2   6.Aug.1998

* t1asm/t1disasm: Changed unknown charstring commands at the request of
  Werner Lemberg and LEE Chun-Yu. An unknown escape in the charstring, like
  12 X, is translated to "escape_X" rather than "UNKNOWN_12_X".


Version 1.5.1   31.May.1998

* t1unmac did not actually understand the -r and -b options. Fixed.

* t1unmac: Added better diagnostics to help you diagnose seeking problems.


Version 1.5   5.Mar.1998

* Initial release with Eddie Kohler as maintainer.

* All: Updated to the GNU program behavior standards (long options, --help,
  --version). Banners removed. Added more error messages.

* t1binary: Removed fixed limit on line length.

* t1binary: Supports Macintosh files, whose lines end in `\r'.

* t1binary: Supports an odd number of hex digits in a line.

* t1asm/t1disasm: Added support for Type 2 commands like `blend' and `add',
  which also appear in some multiple master fonts like Adobe Jenson.

* t1asm/t1disasm: Added support for unknown charstring commands. t1disasm
  translates an unknown command #X to "UNKNOWN_X", and t1asm does the reverse.

* t1asm/t1unmac: Changed default output to PFB.

* t1unmac: Used to be called `unpost'. `t1unmac' is a much better name.
