	the reference arguments.
	rewrite from scratch the functions handling references in .init 
	files to put them in the public domain. Avoid string concatenation
	to ease internationalization.

2003-09-11  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, T2h_i18n.pm, manage_i18n.pl,
	configure.in:
	The ideas come from Derek.
	new script manage_i18n.pl used to manage translation files.
	remove -i18n switch. 
	parse source files to extract strings to be translated.
	complete these strings with the element of %$template_strings
	in manage_i18n.pl and fill the i18n/template file with 
	these strings in the 'en' language hash.
	With the 'all' arg given to manage_i18n.pl the template is 
	regenerated the language files are updated and merged in 
	translations.pl. translations.pl is pasted in texi2html.pl.
	give arguments to the string to be translated: when something
	like %{arg} appears in the string and { 'arg' => 'some string'}
	is given as second argument, %{arg} is replaced by 'some string'
	after retrieval of the translated string.

2003-09-06  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* images, AUTHORS: add images from the Singular project.

2003-09-06  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, T2h_i18n.pm, texi2html.init: new handling of 
	languages in documents.
	instead of using the hash reference $Texi2HTML::I18n::WORDS for
	translation of words, call &Texi2HTML::I18n::get_string (more
	precisely use &$I, a reference on the function). The strings
	are the real english strings and not identifiers.
	The date formatting depends on the language.
	Use translations for months and not a months array.
	Put translations in one file per language and not in T2h_i18n.pm.
	Those files are in the i18n directory. They are to be concatenated
	in the file translated.pl which is required or pasted in texi2html.
	Add a switch -i18n for the specification of a management command
	related with internationalization: if the command is merge, 
	the files in the i18n directory are concatenated into translated.pl;
	if the command is update the files are updated with their own 
	informations and the list of valid strings appearing in T2h_i18n.pm,
	invalid strings are obsoleted but kept.
	* test.sh: add a test for internationalization.

2003-09-05  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: detect @item on @itemize and table line to avoid
	infinite recursion.

2003-09-04  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: handle better @itemize and @table,
	by appending the text appearing on the format command line.
	Use %special_list_commands to inhibit calling the formatting command
	on an item in a given format command.
	if '-' is given to the -output option, output on STDOUT.
	Find more format command mismatches, and handle better formats not
	closed.

2003-09-02  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* Tests/macros/glossary.texi: test for nested macros definitions

2003-08-29  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: support nested macro definitions.

2003-08-29  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.init, texi2html.pl: hide m_cedilla.
	new handling of definition commands, with a specification of the
	definition line parsing.
	get HTML attributes from hash values of %format_map and %style_map.
	Simplify the handling of tables. The default is to use %format_map
	or otherwise a user defined function, $table_list.
	All the css commands are in %css_map. 'pre_style' in $complex_formats
	is taken from %css_map.
	handle @sp.
	Remove $Texi2HTML::STOC_LINES (use $Texi2HTML::OVERVIEW), remove
	$Texi2HTML::TOC (use $Texi2HTML::TOC_LINES), remove $T2H_TOP.
	use references on arrays everywhere (instead of arrays) for
	Texi2HTML::OVERVIEW and Texi2HTML::TOC_LINES.
	Use OVERVIEW consistently.
	use $docu_top when needed, instead of $docu_name.$docu_ext, which
	is wrong if -o is used.
	prepare index entries label text in main program.
	rewrite from scratch most of the function in .init files to put 
	them in the public domain.
	expand macros in macro arguments.
	\ protects @end macro in macros body. This may be wrong.
	ignore space and newline following a region opening command.
	rename -css-file to -css-include.
	Add 'This' to the hashes for buttons, icons and so on.
	Add option -toc-links, create links from headings to toc entries
	with 9 lines from 
	Martin Herbert Dietze <martin@the-little-red-haired-girl.org>
	macros are expanded in macro arguments, taking care of context (in
	@verbatim, @ignore, @comment...).
	Don't remove empty lines from output.
	Reenable handling of -idx-sum.
	* Tests/*: add tests for macros expansion in macro arguments, and
	for command line option style which are not default.
	* examples/*: use code in the public domain.
	In makeinfo.init use makeinfo style for index formatting.

2003-08-29  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

2003-08-29  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* doc/stamp-vti, doc/version.texi: Regenerated.

2003-08-11  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.init, texi2html.pl: don't always open paragraphs 
	in tables and such, only when needed.
	option -output obsoletes -out_file and -subdir. It is the
	same than -out_file when output is not split, and the same than
	-subdir when it is split.
	Handle empty indices.
	Handle better @-commands with letters mixed with other characters.
	Be more carefull about NUMBER_SECTION, such that nothing is numbered
	when it is false.
	Support for @documentencoding.
	* Tests/*: add tests from the doc directory in formatting.
	* doc/*: add a section about installation and make the manual more
	makeinfo friendly. 

2003-08-04  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.init, Tests/test.sh, Tests/ccvs: don't expand info
	section in default settings. Expand info sections for the xemacs
	manual, the viper manual and the texinfo manual. 
	The cvs manual is updated.

2003-08-04  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: pass line numbers to all the 
	functions echoing error messages and use these line numbers
	in error messages. Some error messages rewrited.
	Correct tag for sectionning commands in case raisesection or
	lowersection were used.
	-P option prepends before the document directory, and use an
	array, @Texi2HTML::Config::PREPEND_DIRS.
	Add options --ifhtml, --ifinfo and so on (similar with makeinfo
	options). It is also possible not to expand html now.
	Add entries for xml.
	when a region is expanded the corresponding ifnot region isn't.
	Add support for -css-file option which does the same than in 
	makeinfo (parse the file, and echo the @import part before the
	texi2html css rules, the rules part after the texi2html css rules).
	If split at node and NODE_FILES is true but USE_NODES is not,
	the correct file nema is used for nodes not associated with
	sections and a redirection file is made.
	ignore spaces or not for def*index, pagesizes, syn*index properly.
	bugfixes: line beginning by any command not ignored begins a 
	paragraph, don't ignore text before macro with unknown character).
	no empty style in pass_text.
	misc element have always a navigation printed at foot.
	* Tests/*: add singular test, test for css files, test all html
	formatting and macro within another macro.

2003-08-04  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: don't remove empty line in the 
	second pass, pass_structure.
	collect line numbers/file name/macro expanding text in pass_texi.
	pass these informations down to pass_structure.
	take care of arguments not provided in some @-commands (no file
	in @image, no node in @inforef and so on).
	remove unneeded code in macro text expansion.
	remove leading spaces and newlines in macros arguments.
	add support for @\ (ignore).
	put code extracted from texi2html.pl and placed in texi2html.init,
	covered by the GPL back to texi2html.pl.
	Document the API between texi2html.pl and texi2html.init, i.e.
	document how the formatting functions called by texi2html.pl
	should behave.
	add print_section_header to format section headers.

2003-08-01  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: add option '-noexpand' as a synonym for '-no-expand'
	like Derek suggested.

2003-07-31  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* texi2html.pl (T2H_OPTIONS->{'no-expand'}): Remove useless linkage.

2003-07-31  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: A new option -no-expand which does 
	the reverse of -expand.
	Text before the first @node or sectionning command is 
	outputted as part of the first section. A new option enables the 
	reverse: if -ignore-preamble-text is set (variable 
	$IGNORE_PREAMBLE_TEXT) this text is ignored.
	Handle macros appearing in that part of texinfo files (@direntry
	and @dircategory ignored, @shorttitlepage handled).
	Ignore everything at the beginning of the file until \input or an
	@-command preceded by optionnal spaces.
	better handling of @titlefont.

2003-07-29  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>
	
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: if split, top and misc elements (about,
	toc, ...) always have a bottom navigation panel.
	If there is no @top and the @node Top isn't associated with any section
	it is considered to be the top element.
	The top name is Top when there is no name nor title (previously was
	"Untitled Document").
	bugfix: top element handled as top even when it is the last element.

2003-07-22  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, examples/*: add support for @cartouche
	and @titlefont.
	preliminary support for css. All the element needing style have a 
	class attribute. The commands which are associated with a class by
	makeinfo have that class too. The styles are in the <head> in <style>.
	A new init file, inlinestyle.init, should be used when style 
	attributes within html elements are wanted.
	A new option, "-U value" does the same than "@clear value" (makeinfo
	has that option, too).
	A new configuration variable L2H_HTML_VERSION for the html version 
	passed to latex2html.
	@tex or @math don't start a new paragraph.
	* Tests/*: test for @raisesections and @lowersections, and for 
	@cartouche.

2003-07-11  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* Tests/ccvs: update cvs manual. This should fixe the issue of rcs 
	tags expanding in html manual files in ccvs_res.
	* Tests/*: sync with code. Add missing test result files.
	* Tests/Makefile.am: add new test subdirs. Better cleaning.
	* l2h.init: add init file for latex2html.

2003-07-10  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* Tests/nodes_texinfo/--and-hyphenation.html: Removed this accidentally
	added file at Pat's request.

2003-07-10  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, Tests/test.sh: command line option names use '-' 
	instead of '_' between words (for example dump_texi becomes dump-texi).
	* Tests/*: remove unneeded html and passfirst files.

2003-07-03  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, *.init: use a separate namespace for the config
	variables: Texi2HTML::Config. Use the Texi2HTML:: namespace for
	variables set in texi2html and used in the init files subroutines.
	Use Texi2HTML::LaTeX2HTML namespace for latex2html related code.
	Use Texi2HTML::I18n namespace for internationalisation.
	Variables related with latex2html are removed from texi2html.init
	and put in l2h.init.
	harmonize function names style (all like get_index and not GetIndex).
	* Makefine.am, texi2html.pl: install examples init files in shared 
	directory.
	try to find init files in the current directory, then the .texi2html 
	user directory, the local texi2html directory and lastly the shared
	texi2html directory.

2003-06-17  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: error messages go to STDERR instead of STDIN
	* Tests/test.sh: add -x to perl invocation to avoid perl trying
	to execute @PERL@. Small fixes.
	* Tests/README: added README file in Tests to explain how to make
	tests.

	of the document.
	use a different formatting for menu entries in other environments than 
	menus.
	cleaning of code.
	use close_stack in all the passes to close environments not rightly
	closed. Fix some places where stack wasn't closed rightly.
	New direction, 'NodeNext' and 'NodePrev' which contains the prev node 
	and next node which may be different from Next and Prev for sections.

	spaces and arguments following commands are removed or kept in the 
	same way than makeinfo does.
	* Tests/*: add tests for environments not closed. Sync with code.

2003-05-09  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: refs to other manuals conforms to 
	makeinfo with separated files for nodes.
	If  $T2H_NODE_FILES (-node-files) is true one file per node is created
	which redirects to the real file or is the node file (if T2H_SPLIT
	at node), to allow for cross manual references.
	Add a T2H_NO_TEXI hash similar with T2H_HREF, T2H_NODES...
	and T2H_THISDOC{title_no_texi} to have a texi free and thus html free
	text for nodes/sections/title to be used in the <title> which element
	which cannot contain other html elements. Also usefull for files with
	node names generation.
	t2h_set_body_text and t2h_protect_html put in texi2html.init to be
	able to make changes more easily.
	$T2H_TOC_LIST_STYLE is used for style in toc. Makes customisation
	easier too.
	* examples/html32.init: init file for html 3.2 generation
	* Tests/test.sh: add validation
	* Tests/*: tests for files with node names generation

2003-05-07  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: put a label in splitted index.
	splitted indices which are not at the level of splitting are kept
	in the same file but in different sections.
	different horizontal rules are global variables.
	functions formatting index summary and index entry split between 
	a function in texi2html.pl and smaller functions doing the real
	formatting in texi2html.init.
	no formatting is done in texi2html.init.
	heading appears in documents with only one section.
	if $T2H_SEPARATED_FOOTNOTES is false (-noseparated_footnotes)
	the footnotes are on the page they appear. More possibility
	of customization of footnotes (insert things before and after each
	footnotes and all footnotes).
	use top file for the top element even when there is no @top section.
	when there is a top element and splitting, no other element than
	the top element appear in the top file.
	* examples/makeinfo.init: format footnotes like makeinfo
	* examples/xhtml.init: init file for xhtml
	* Tests/test.sh: little fixes
	* Tests/*: all tex stuff taken from verbatim_html and put in tex.texi.
	tests for index entries in top and before top.
	tests for documents with only one section or node or no node.

2003-05-02  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: 3 split commands: split at
	chapter, section or for every node (previously node and section 
	where the same than node now).
	specific section footer.
	find prev and next like makeinfo.
	new directions, for nodes: NodeUp (up for node) and Following (next
	node in reading order).
	if in detailmenu menu entries are not used to find next and prev.
	only one Top in nodes and anchors. Any case combination accepted
	for any reference.
	don't close { when not associated with an @command.
	reintroduced code for counting words.
	new possibilities for buttons. If this is a ref to a scalar, the
	text appears in navigation. If it is an array, the first element
	is a direction used for the href, the second element is a scalar
	ref for the text (see makeinfo.init in examples for an example).
	* Tests/*: test for recursive nodes references and other little
	tests
	* examples/*: new directory for examples of config files. There
	is a file which tries to have an output which looks like makeinfo
	--html output (makeinfo.init).

2003-04-30  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: add the node as element when there

	it is possible not to have next or prev for node.
	any case combination of top is accepted in nodes, menus and 
	nodes directions. Not changed in anchors and refs (makeinfo shows
	that kind of inconsistencies too).
	the top_element it the @top section, then the Top node 
	and last the first element.
	'(file) node' and '(file)' accepted in menus and nodes references.
	better looking verbose output.
	* Tests/*: tests for documents without sections and double top

2003-04-28  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: No heading for top, as print_Top 
	allready does it.
	if $T2H_USE_NODES (command line -use-nodes) is set, the nodes are
	used as sections when they are not associated with a section.
	find sections structure before handling nodes.
	no more use of menu level for structuring.
	@html sections don't close paragraphs.
	* Tests/*: tests for document structure. Sync with code.

	and .2 files in regenerate and clean
	* Tests/*: results of tests added

2003-04-10  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: labels were put 2 times in special
	sections (Top, about, toc...).
	in vtable, ftable and table, even with an empty first item we
	begin a <dd> as only <dd> and <dt> are allowed to follow <dl>.
	Right labels are put in special sections and files are omitted
	when the href is on the same file.
	change &#156; to &oelig; and &#140; to &OElig; (as tidy do)
	* Tests/*/nodetest.texi: test for more simple special commands

2003-04-09  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: formatting put in texi2html.init
	hrefs to anchors and index entries which are in footnotes are right
	scan_texi changed to have a stack
	verbose and debug goes to STDERR
	unusefull empty lines removed
	new option -dump_texi used to debug, dumps the result of pass_texi
	to a file

	better handling of @math and @sc
	* Tests/*: a little more things tested.

2003-04-04  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: deffn and the like better handled
	preformatted sections are closed when there is a new format
	and reopened right after the format such that there is no
	validation error. The preformatted state is kept within
	menu, deff body, simple formats, tables, with tt instead of
	pre for terms, as pre isn't allowed in dt, but not in 
	indices.
	simple macros are better handled when texi macros are removed
	or in preformatted sections.
	copying/end copying and insertcopying handled
	@head_lines containing things which should be before the navigation
	panel are used to get the labels for elements.
	first page of index is handled like a normal format
	* Tests/*: more tests for imbrications.
	
2003-04-02  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: footnotes better handled, they have a separated
	stack, state and text.
	footnotes, anchors and refs can be mixed with better results.
	$value{_title}... have only their texinfo expanded during
	pass_texi, including values, macros and so on and the html
	is generated during pass_text.
	* Tests/*: minor changes, more tests.

2003-04-02  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: macros splitted by 3 paragraphs are better handled.
	more isolation of formatting.
	better generation of index keys from commands, with more macros
	replaced by the right letter or symbol.
	better handling of @things{} in preformatted sections.
	preformatted sections handled with a new format, preformatted (similar
	with what is done for paragraphs). Some validation errors avoided.
	commands for tables are handled.
	index entries have the right file/id from their place.
	The files are omitted from hrefs when the href points to the same file.
	* Tests/*: formatting/imbrications.texi added. Sync with code.

2003-03-27  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: rewrite of the parsing of texi
	and of the handling of sectionning.
	pass0 is now pass_texi. It still only generates texinfo.
	pass_texi now also collects informations from sectionning commands
	index entries, printindex commands.
	pass1 through pass4 are now in just one pass, pass_text.
	between pass_texi and pass_text, the information is used to figure
	out the document and indices structure.
	pass_text reparses the texinfo generated by pass_texi and
	produces html. All the formatting is done in isolated subroutines
	such that it is easy to change the formatting witout bothering
	with the parsing.
	pass_text uses scan_line to process a line.
	A stack is used which holds opened macros and formats. Thus the 
	html is always closed and should be valid.
	The document structure seems right with this approach, unnumbered 
	sections are at the right level and indices don't break the document
	structure anymore.
	* Tests/*: more tests for the @macros. Other minor modifications.
	sync with new code.

2003-03-06  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* T2h_i18n.pm: added  the licence
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, check_texinfo.pl.in: check function
	put in check_texinfo.pl.in. T2H_EXPAND is now an array such that
	more than one type may be expanded
	* texi2html.pl: added a new pass before the other ones, pass0 and
	a function scan_line0 used in that pass. During that pass the
	ifhtml, ifnot*, the comments and multiple empty lines, the macros, 
	values and includes are handled. No html is generated. the
	different things that are expanded can now be within a line and 
	not necessarily at the begining of the line.
	The handling of values and macros is not changed.
	scan_line handles more constructs (newlines (still bugged), 
	verbatim, html and tex, deffn (incomplete)).
	new function close_stack which might be used to close the things 
	forgotten by users or between paragraphs.
	new function substitute_text which uses scan_line to render
	arbitrary text.
	little improvements in menu comments handling.
	accent_map/do_accent should handle all the accents.
	* Tests/test.sh: minor changes.
	* Tests/*: regenerated tests to keep in sync.
	added formatting/imbrications.texi to test for imbricated things.
	* configure, configure.in: added check_texinfo.pl.in.

2003-02-28  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init, T2h_i18n.pm: options specifications
	moved from texi2html.init to texi2html.pl, such that texi2html.init
	resembles a regular user init file. internationalization move
	from texi2html.init to T2h_i18n.pm. 
	* configure.in: added substitution of T2h_i18n.pm within 
	texi2html.pl
	* configure, doc/Makefile.in, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, 
	Tests/Makefile.in: regenerated with automake-1.6.3, autoconf-2.53

2003-02-24  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* Tests: small fixes, more tests showing brokeness of texi2html
	for some features and info and tex differences. 
	A change in texinfo.txi to permit handling of verb despite some 
	substitutions have allready been done
	* texi2html.pl: add comment about the formats in texinfo 4.5
	setlocale is used in case of tests to avoid change in ordering of 
	indices while testing against a reference file
	footnotes refs and image handled by parse_line, which calls a 
        sub routine (do_footnote, do_ref or do_image).
        for footnotes, _$doc_num instead of $docu_doc
	appended tp keep track of the file of the footnote, such that it 
	is easier to match. 
	instead of <!--::${section}::--> added before printindex, _$sec_num 
	is appended to printindex, to keep track of the
	section number.
        images extention is taken from the @image tag if available
        everything which was splitted accross pass2, pass3 and pass4 is
        now done in pass2.
        in pass3 only very little cleaning is done, pass4 is removed.
        
2003-02-21  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: added handling of overbar accent @= is transformed
	in =
	the handling of multi lines macro is done in a function, scan_line
	which scans a line, keeping a record of the text allready ready,
	the macro stack and a state which for now only contains 'verb' if in
	@verb macro. The @verb macro is handled by this function (but since
	things have allready been substituted, it cannot give the right 
	result easily)

2003-02-19  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: T2H_DEFAULT_button_icon_img behaves
	better when it has some undef arguments
	the variables which may be redefined by the user are now global. 
	They are grouped in texi2html.init, and also in the Declaration in 
	texi2html.pl and sorted by class.
	new elements in %T2H_THISDOC for items which are global but shouldn't
	be redefined by the user (instead of $T2H_HOMEPAGE, $THISPROG...).
	t2h_Init_global has been removed and the code scattered according to
	the principles above
	other minor fixes

2003-02-18  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: handle @verbatim, and @html differently. Added 
	push_until function which shift from a lines array and push to another 
	array until @end tag. Remove PROTECTTAG
	remove unneeded push of index entry for vtable or ftable which
	created 2 indices entry
	* Tests: added more tests

2003-02-13  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: avoid using $_ in functions, as it is a global
	variable, use my variables instead
	* Tests/test.sh: if called with arguments, the test specified by 
	the arguments is the only one done
	* Tests/*: add Makefile.in, more subdirectories, synchronise
	reference files with changes in the code

2003-02-12  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: add prototype for the functions ; remove

2003-02-11  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: unused variables removed
	use_bibliography removed, lots of global variables made lexical.
	open renamed open_file to avoid clashing with perl builtin.
	remove sub init_input, the initialization is done in the 
	script itself.
	add meta http-equiv="Content-Type" tag for the charset
 	declaration.

2003-02-06  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: some unused variables removed
	use_acc not used anymore, accents are always handled
	Remove a lot of global variables. Use global lexical or lexically
	scoped variables (with my) when possible. Pass variables as arguments
	when the function is in texi2html.init
	bugfixes: frame target is the top file, and not the toc file
	during pass1 some lines where pushed in @lines2 instead of @lines
	* Tests/test.sh: ignore CVS directory when doing diffs

2003-02-03  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: Remove handling of setref which is a TeX macro. The 
	corresponding texinfo macro is anchor.

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, Tests/test.sh, Tests/Makefile.am Tests/*:
	Files used for testing added, texinfo manuals and the html results for 
	some of the texinfo manuals

2003-01-30  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: fix nesting of multi line style macros (previously,
	@kbd{@code{my
	thing}}
	became
	<kbd>my thing<kbd><code></code> (or something approaching)
	no style substitution is done in indexes (indexes are already good
	html). Added %sec2index which is undef for a section name not in index,
	1 if the section name is in index.
	the value of $docu_doc set if $T2H_OUT was set (option -o) wasn't 
	used to define docu_doc_file, thus the output file was the basename 
	of the texinfo file with extension appended, and not $T2H_OUT.


2003-01-28  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: fixes in the handling of characters which are

	and treated as comments
	Added a style handle for @bullet (do_bullet) such that @bullet{text}
	is handled
	Cedilla are now accepted in node names. Added protect_cedilla and
	unprotect_cedilla functions.
	* texi2html.pl, texi2html.init: Add -test option which sets 
	$T2H_TODAY $T2H_USER $THISPROG to given values. This is in order 
	to be able to compare with reference files for testing purproses.

2003-01-16  Patrice Dumas <dumas@centre-cired.fr>

	* texi2html.pl: @H{a} is changed in a'' and not &aacute; which was

	  o default language to 'en' wasn't working which led to empty LANG=""
	    in <BODY>
	  o missing </FONT> in footer blurb
	  o when the ToC was generated in some cases, the code used
	    <UL></UL> to indent, but didn't have any <LI> tags.  <blockquote>
	    is now used in such cases, instead.

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed severe macro expansion bug.  Macro argument
	  parsing code did not handle nested braces ('{' and '}') at
	  all, thus valid macro invocations such as
	  "@mymacro{Hello @emph{there} @strong{world}.}" would fail.
	  Prior to this fix, @mymacro would be handed the argument
	  "Hello @emph{there", which is clearly incorrect.  Now @mymacro
	  correctly receives "Hello @emph{there} @strong{world}." as its
	  argument.  This fix also deals properly with the protected brace
	  sequences \{, \}, @{, and @}.

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed severe macro expansion bug.  Macro argument
	  parsing code did not handle arguments split over multiple lines,
	  such as "@mymacro{Hello \n world.}".  Now it correctly handles
	  macro invocations split across any number of lines, and properly
	  flags an error at the correct location if the user forgets the
	  closing brace '}'.

	* texi2html.pl: Fixed formatting errors in expansions of @SPACE,
	  @TAB, and @NL (where SPACE, TAB, and NL represent the actual
	  space, tab, and newline characters).  The Texinfo manual
	  explicitly states that each of these sequences should expand to a
	  "printable" space in the [rendered] output.  The example given in
	  the manual shows that "Spacey@ @ @ @ example" should expand to
	  "Spacey    example".  However, texi2html was only emitting the
	  insignificant whitespace ' ' and '\n' into the HTML output which
	  did not properly preserve the hard spaces in "Spacey    example".
	  Now each of these directives expands to '&nbsp;' instead.

	* texi2html.pl: Made aesthetic improvement to the output of @file{},
	  @option{}, and @samp{}.  The argument string is now quoted with
	  ` and ' _after_ the style has been applied.  For instance,
	  @samp{perl} now expands to "`<samp>perl</samp>'", whereas it used
	  to expand to "<samp>`perl'</samp>".  In my tests, this change
	  results in more aesthetically pleasing rendered output on various
	  browsers.

2000-08-16  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: Bug fix from: "joseph" <joseph@freenet.de>
	MySimple.pm should be 'require'd, but checked is still texi2html.init.

2000-08-14  Karl Heinz Marbaise   <khmarbaise@gmx.de>
        * new command line switch (Test purposes only!)
          to show new layout in HTML for @def stuff.
        * Texinfo-Documentation updated.
          - New chapter about ``customizing HTML'' started.
          - multiple files instead of one.
          - subdirectory doc.

2000-07-27  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	older versions of Getopt::Long which do not support his function.

2000-07-11  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	  - sets language of document, unless overwritten by -lang, or 
	    explicitly set $T2H_LANG

	  ambiguate current options
	
2000-07-09  Karl Heinz Marbaise   <khmarbaise@gmx.de>
        * Texinfo-Documentation:
          - fixes from Peter Moulder <pjm@bofh.asn.au> incorporated
            into manual.
          - Updated Manual
            o improved
            o indices for options, variables of script.
            o much more.
        * texi2html.init:
          - improvements for different languages
            (month names, words in different languages).

	though) 
	* Distribution: Incorporated texi2html.texi authored by Karl Heinz
	Marbaise <khmarbaise@gmx.de> (THANKS!)
	
	* texi2html.1.in: Updates to reflect new cmd-line options

	* Rewrote handling of command-line options:
	- based on (My)Simple.pm, and Getopt::Long
	-help now works and is up-to-date
	-help 1 lists also "not-so-important" options
	-help 2 lists also obsolete options
	- the following options were renamed: (old options still work, but 
	  are marked as obsolete)
	    verbose            ==> Verbose
	    section_navigation ==> sec_nav
	    output_file        ==> out_file
	- the following options are obsoleted (still work, though):
 	    no-section_navigation ==> -nosec_nav
	    use_acc		  ==> ALWAYS use accents
	    expandinfo		  ==> -expand info	
	    expandtex		  ==> -expand tex
	    no_verbose            ==> default case
	    monolithic            ==> default case
	    split_node            ==> -split section
	    split_chapter         ==> -split chapter
	
2000-06-27  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* Fixed bug in anchor generation (reported by various people who
	noticed that @anchor may not be on one line with @item)
	* Fixed infinite loop on missing '@end macro'
	* texi2html.pl: -expandinfo and -expandtex command-line options
	for backward compatibility

	* texi2html.init: Use ISO 639 language codes for keys in $T2H_LANG 
	hash.

2000-06-26  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: new command-line options:
	 -nonumber, -nomenu to unset the default -number -menu

	* texi2html.pl: As suggested by "Richard Y. Kim" <ryk@coho.net>:
	insert <A NAME="#nodename"></A> for each
	nodename in a document (nodename is exactly as in texinfo
	source). 
	
	* From: "Richard Y. Kim" <ryk@coho.net>
	  o $T2H_FRAMES internal boolean variable which defaults to 0
	  o -frames command line option which changes $T2H_FRAMES to 1.
	  o If $T2H_FRAMES is 1, then two additional files are output.
	    If mydoc.html is output normally, then mydoc_frame.html
	    and mydoc_frame_toc.html files are output.
	  o The functions T2H_print_frame, and T2H_print_toc_frame are used to
		generate contents of these files.
	  o The T2H_DEFAULT_print_frame and T2H_DEFAULT_print_toc_frame
	    (defined in texi2html.ini) do the following:
       mydoc_frame.html is the short file with <FRAME> tags.
       mydoc_frame_toc.html is basically the short table of contents
       which goes on the narrow left frame.
	
	* texi2html.pl: @,{c} --> &ccedil;

	* from brlewis@alum.mit.edu:
	    o Changes to facilitate CSS
	    o -toc_file option for those who want the TOC to be index.html
	    o Config variable $T2H_HREF_DIR_INSTEAD_FILE:
	       if set (e.g., to index.html) replace hrefs to this file 
               (i.e., to index.html) by ./
	* texi2html.pl: index generation after value substitution

2000-05-31  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: for def_map stuff <A NAME=..> before output
	* texi2html.pl: applied patch from "Richard Y. Kim" <ryk@ap.com>
	                for @refs with 2 or 3 args: use 3rd or 2nd argor
			section (in that order) as text for reference.

	argument.

2000-04-08  Peter Moulder  <pjm@bofh.asn.au>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Generate texi2html in
	configure script instead of Makefile.  (Due mostly to
	Teun Burgers.)

	* README, TODO, texi2html.1.in, texi2html.init, texi2html.pl:
	Misc. documentation changes.

	* fixed table within itemize and parapgraphs
	* surpress <P></P> when within <pre>
	* allow @include within top node

2000-04-03  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: $docu_top=$T2H_TOP_FILE || $docu_name. $docu_ext;

2000-03-31  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: $complex_format_map for complex enclosing
	constructs where which: 
	* texi2html.init:$T2H_EXAMPLE_INDENT_CELL,
	$T2H_SMALL_EXAMPLE_INDENT_CELL, $T2H_SMALL_FONT_SIZE for
	customizing indent/font size of block-enclosing texinfo command
	(@example, @format, @display, etc).
	* Release version 1.61.

2000-03-29  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* Cleaned up texi2html.pl and added loading of init file (when
	texi2html.pl is run) such that it can directly be used as script
	(otherwise, debugging is much harder).

	* fixed getpwuid 

	* Added T2H_print_chapter_header, T2H_print_chapter_footer for
	more fine-grained control of T2H_SPLIT eq 'chapter', added option
	-section_navigation, $T2H_SECTION_NAVIGATION to suppress output of
	navigation panels per section

	* Changed naming and and calling convention of customizable subs:
	They all have prefix T2H_, are called with &$T2H_, are assigned by 
	$T2H_<name> = \&T2H_DEFAULT_<name>.

	* texi2html.init: Incorporated changed of Peter Moulder:
	
2000-03-27  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* debian/*: deleted
	* texi2html.pl: Incorporated changes of Peter Moulder
	* texi2html.pl: Automatic node pointer creation added
	* texi2html.pl: @enddots, @exclamdown, etc added

2000-03-26  Peter Moulder  <reiter@netspace.net.au>

	* texi2html.init: Address a couple of weblint/tidy warnings.

	* texi2html.init:
	* texi2html.pl: The init file is inserted into the executable at
	build time (see Makefile.am).

	* texi2html.pl: Source each of @sysconfdir@/texi2htmlrc and
	$HOME/.texi2htmlrc if it exists, after processing texi2html.init
	but before anything on the command-line.
	
	Allow -split_chapter, -split_node, -monolithic options, which is
	what previous versions of texi2html used.
	
	Support `@command{...}'.
	
	Add --help, --version options.
	
	-sidx isn't used, so comment out.

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.am:
	* autogen.sh: New files.

	* configure.in: Change version number from 1.60Beta to 1.59.2.

	* debian/*: New files.

	* texi2html.1.in:
	* texi2html.pl: Extract the man page into a separate file.  At the
	moment, the man page is even installed separately (with
	texi2html.pl having `.so @MANPAGE_PATH@' in place of the
	manpage).  Conceivably we could add a configure option to
	construct everything as one file like we used to; just replace
	that text with `@EMBEDDED_MANPAGE@', which would be replaced with
	either the existing `.so @MANPAGE_PATH@' or with texi2html.1
	contents the way texi2html.init is done.
	
2000-03-14  Olaf Bachmann  <obachman@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* texi2html.pl: center @image by default, can be overwritten by
	T2H_CENTER_IMAGE (sunshine@sunshineco.com)

# vim:tabstop=8:shiftwidth=8
