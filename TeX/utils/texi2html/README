There is as yet no corresponding newsgroup. 

For bug reports, please include enough information for the maintainers
to reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the version number of Texi2html and the program(s) involved (use --version).
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug (crucial!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- anything else that you think would be helpful.

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them against the
source files (e.g., against texi2html.pl, or texi2html.init) with
`diff -c' or `diff -u' and include ChangeLog entries.

When sending email, please do not encode or split the messages in any
way if at all possible; it's much easier to deal with one large message
than many small ones.  GNU shar is a convenient way of packaging
multiple and/or binary files for email.
