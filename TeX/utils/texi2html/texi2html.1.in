.SH NAME
texi2html \- a Texinfo to HTML converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B texi2html [options] file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Texi2html
converts the given Texinfo file to a set of HTML files. It tries to handle
most of the Texinfo commands. It creates hypertext links for cross-references,
footnotes...
.PP
.I Texi2html
may furthermore use latex2html to generate HTML (code and/or images) for @math
and @iftex tags (see the 
.B \-\-l2h
option).
.PP
.I Texi2html
creates several files depending on the contents of the Texinfo file and on
the chosen options (see FILES).
.PP
The HTML files created by
.I texi2html
are closer to TeX than to Info.
.SH OPTIONS
Options may be abbreviated to th shortests unique prefix. The
following is only an incomplete list of the available options: 
.TP 12
.B \-\-help [1|2]

or all recognised (including obsolete) command-line options, and exit. 
.TP
.B \-\-ifinfo \-\-iftex \-\-ifxml \-\-ifplaintext \-\-ifhtml
Expand @ifinfo, @iftex and @tex, @ifxml and @xml, @ifplaintext, 
@ifhtml and @html regions, and don't expand @ifnot 
corresponding regions (default: ifhtml).
.TP
.B \-\-no\-ifinfo \-\-no\-iftex \-\-no\-ifxml \-\-no\-ifplaintext \-\-no\-html
Don't expand @ifinfo, @iftex, @ifxml, @ifplaintext regions and expand
@ifnot corresponding regions.
.TP
.B \-I \fIdir\fP
Append \fIdir\fP to the directory list searched for included files.
.TP
.B \-P \fIdir\fP
Prepend \fIdir\fP to the directory list searched for included files.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-menu
Don't show the Texinfo menus; by default they are shown.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-number
Don't number the sections.
.TP
.B \-\-split chapter|section|node
Split the output into several HTML files (one per main chapter/section or node).
.TP
.B \-\-l2h
Use latex2html for content of @math and @tex tags. Content must be such that 
both, latex and tex, can translate it correctly. I.e., no tex-only constructs 
must be used.
.TP
.B \-\-l2h\-l2h \fIprog\fP  
Use \fIprog\fP as latex2html program (default \fIlatex2html\fP). 
Program must be executable. 
.TP
.B \-\-l2h\-init \fIfile\fP  
Use \fIfile\fP as latex2html init file. \fIfile\fP should be used to specify in which way latex2html handles mathematical expressions and formulas. 

Note that latex2html locates  
(and uses) init-files in the following order (provided they exist): 
(1) global init file (usually in latex2html source dir) 
(2) $HOME/.latex2html_init 
(3) ./.latex2html_init 
(4) init file given on command line.  
.TP
.B \-\-l2h\-tmp \fIdir\fP
Use \fIdir\fP as tmp dir for latex2html. This directory (resp. its path) 
must not contain a dot  (i.e., a ".").
.TP 
.B \-\-l2h\-clean
remove all intermediate files generated by latex2html (prevents caching!)  
.TP 
.B \-\-l2h\-skip
Do not really run latex2html. Use (kept) files of previous runs, instead.
.TP
.B \-\-Verbose
Give a verbose output. 
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print version and exit.
.PP
.SH FILES
Initialisation options are read first from @sysconfdir@/texi2html/Config
(the exact location being changeable with the
.RI --sysconfdir= dir
option to the configure script), then from $HOME/.texi2html/Config,
then any command-line options including \-\-init\-file options;
with later settings overriding earlier ones.
.P
By default
.I texi2html
my creates the following files (foo being the name of the Texinfo file):
.TP 16
.B foo_toc.html
The table of contents (if @contents is present).
.TP
.B foo.html
The document's contents or the Top element.
.TP
.B foo_fot.html
The footnotes (if any).
.TP
.B foo_abt.html
An help section.
.TP
.B foo_l2h_img*
Images generated by latex2html (if any).
.PP
When used with the
.B \-\-split
option, it creates several files (one per chapter or node), named
.B foo_n.html
(n being the index of the chapter or node), and the
.B foo.html
file contains the Top element.
.PP
Otherwise it creates only one file:
.B foo.html
