Getting Started with texi2html
==============================

'texi2html' converts texinfo documents to HTML.

Texinfo is the official documentation format of the GNU project. It
uses a single source file to produce both on-line information and
printed output. For more details about texinfo, see
http://www.texinfo.org. 

In contrast to the HTML produced by 'makeinfo --html' (the 'makeinfo'
program is part of the Texinfo distribution), the HTML output of
'texi2html' is highly configurable. Among others, with 'texi2html' you 
can customize your entire page layout (like headers, footers, style
sheets, etc), split documents at various levels and use 'latex2html' to
convert @tex sections.

'texi2html' should reasonably convert all Texinfo 4.6 constructs. If
not, please send a bug report to 'users@texi2html.cvshome.org'.


To create HTML of texinfo documents
===================================

Make sure that you have 'texi2html' correctly installed on your
system. The general synopsis of 'texi2html' is

    texi2html [options] texinfo-source-file

Without any options, this will create the file <docname>.html where 
<docname> is the basename of your texinfo files.

See the beginning of the file 'texi2html.init' for explanations of
command-line options and their default values, or run 'texi2html -h'
for a short overview of the most important options.


Customizing texi2html
=====================

Initialisation options are read first from
'/usr/local/etc/texi2html/Config' (the exact location being changeable with
the '--sysconfdir=dir' option to the configure script), then from
$HOME/.texi2html/Config, then any command-line options including -init-file
options; with later settings overriding earlier ones.

The default initialisation options are defined in the
'texi2html.init' file contained in the Texi2html distribution (in
fact, 'make' pastes this file into beginning of texi2html.pl and
generates the actual 'texi2html' script this way.).

To customize 'texi2html' it is best if you copy the appropriate
sections from the 'texi2html.init' file into an appropriate local
initialization file, make the necessary changes there, and then have
'texi2html' read this initialisation file by one of the means described
above.

For an example on what you can produce with 'texi2html' have a look
at the following sites:

(Please send me your sites, if you'd like to have them listed here).


Documentation of texi2html
==========================
The texi2html Texinfo manual is not complete, yet (we are working on
it). In any case, you might want to have a look at the comments in the
'texi2html.init' file for explanations about customizable parameters
and at the (not up-to-date) texi2html man page for an overview of
texi2html's synopsis.
