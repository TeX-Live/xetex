	Building zziplib-0.13.58 as part of the TL tree
	===============================================

This directory libs/zziplib/ uses a proxy Makefile.am to build the zziplib
library from the unmodified (*) source tree in libs/zziplib/zziplib-x.y.z/,
bypassing the original build system.

(*) The directory zziplib-x.y.z-PATCHES contains patches (if any) applied to
the original source tree.

As far as applicable, the tests in libs/zziplib-x.y.z/configure.ac have been
copied to libs/zziplib/configure.ac.
