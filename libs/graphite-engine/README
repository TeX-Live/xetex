			GRAPHITE ENGINE

The Graphite smart-font engine is the bit that takes a Unicode string, font 
formatting information (features, size, etc.) and a font and returns a set 
of positioned glyphs. Graphite also does more than this, in that it can
handle cursor tracking and interaction with the application for string 
selection, etc.

In order to interact with the application or system, Graphite is embedded in 
an application. You may want to write a custom font and render backend or use one 
of the provided backends in the wrappers project.

The *nix build system uses autoconf and automake including all the 
conventions of those tools. This includes extended support for debug, 
maintenance mode, etc. See the GNU autotools info pages for the appropriate 
tools for help.

If you have checked this source out of the Graphite Subversion repository or 
a similar version control system you will need to generate the autotools 
scripts and files (configure, Makefile.in etc) to do this run:

    autoreconf --install
        
Please see INSTALL for information on building

NOTE: 
If you modify any configure.in or Makefile.am file you will need rerun 
autoreconf like so:

    autoreconf
    
For those changes to affect the configure script and makefiles.
