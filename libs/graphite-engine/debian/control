Description: Development files for SILGraphite
 SILGraphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts"
 capable of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such
 as: contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs,
 bidirectionality, stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to 
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensability. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the SILGraphite rendering engine for a given writing system is
 specified through extra tables added to a TrueType font. These tables are
 generated by compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into
 a font using grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the headers and development libraries.
