Description:
    The GrFSM class, which is the mechanism that examines input in a glyph stream and

	A machine class range consists of a range of contiguous glyph IDs that map to
	a single column in the FSM (a machine class). (Note that there might be more than one
	range mapping to a given column.)

	Keep in mind that these "classes" are completely different from the classes that
	are used for substitution. These are used only for matching by the FSM.

};

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The finite state machine that is used to match sequences of glyphs and
	determine which rule to apply. There is one FSM per pass.

	The states in the FSM are grouped and ordered in the following way:
		- non-accepting states (no rule completely matched)
		- accepting non-final states (a rule matched, but a longer rule is possible)
		- final states (a rule matched and no longer rule is possible)
	In other words, we have:
		- transition,	  non-accepting
		- transition,	  accepting
		- non-transition, accepting
	The transition states have information about the next state to transition to;
	the accepting states have information about the rule(s) that matched.

	There are three main data structures that are part of the finite state machine:

	(1) the transition matrix: m_prgprgrowXitions. It contains a row for each transition
		state (non-accepting states plus accepting non-final states), and a column for each
		machine class. The cell values indicate the next state to transition to for the
		matched input. A positive number indicates that the next state is a non-accepting state;
		a negative value indicates an accepting state. Zero means there is no next state;
		no more matches are possible; machine has "jammed."

	(2) the matched-rule list: m_prgrulnMatched. This is a list of rule numbers,
		which are indices into the pass's action- and constraint-code arrays.
		It contains the numbers of the rules matched by the first accepting state,
		followed by those matched by the second accepting state, etc. For each state,
		the rules must be ordered using the same order of the rules in the RDL file.

	(3) the matched-rule-offsets list: m_prgirulnMin. This gives the starting index into
		the matched-rule list for each accepting state. (Non-accepting states are not included,
		so the first item is for state m_crowNonAcpt.)

	In addition, the FSM interacts with the action- and constraint-code lists in the pass
	itself. These lists are indexed by rule number (the values of m_prgrulnMatched).
	When some input matches the rule, the constraint-code is run; if it succeeds,
	the rule number is returned to the caller and that rule is applied (ie, the action-code
	is run).

	Hungarian: fsm

	Other hungarian:
		row - row (state)
		col	- column (machine class)
		ruln - rule number

	REVIEW: This is quite a time-critical class, and there are two potential optimizations
	that have been proposed for the value of a cell:

	(1) use a negative cell number to indicate an accepting state and a positive number
		to indicate a non-accepting state. So this gives a comparison with zero rather than
		some arbitrary number

	(2)	have the positive numbers--the most common case--be the actual byte offset into the
		table rather than the row number. This saves matrix multiplication at each step,
		ie, "m_prgsnTransitions[(row * m_ccol) + col]".

	The two versions are implemented in RunTransitionTable and RunTransitionTableOptimized.
	Do these seem to be worth the inconvenience of added complexity	in understanding
	and debugging?
