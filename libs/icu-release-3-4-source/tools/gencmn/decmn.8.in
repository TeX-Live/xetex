.SH DESCRIPTION
.B decmn
reads the ICU memory-mappable data file
.I archive
and writes each of the
packaged files that it contains as a separate file in the destination
directory.
.PP
.B decmn
also writes a list of these files on its standard output. This list of
files can later be used, along with the individual files that have
been generated, to produce a new common data file using
.BR gencmn (8).
.\" Note that the output of
.\" .B decmn
.\" is not in the format expected by
.\" .BR gencmn (8).
.\" One can obtain a suitable file by filtering the output through
.\" .B "sed -e '1,2d' -e 's/[^=]*=//' -e '/^endfiles$/d"
.\" which transforms it into a simple list of filenames.
