README for libs/icu directory

This directory contains a *MODIFIED* version of the ICU library source code,
for use by XeTeX.

The directory icu-x.y.z/ contains the subdirectory source/ of the ICU
distribution as obtained from the tarball icu4c-x_y_z-src.tgz, with changes
for TeX Live as described in icu-x.y.z-PATCHES/TL-Changes, and modified for
XeTeX (primarily extensions to non-Latin support in the Layout Engine) by
patches icu-x.y.z-PATCHES/patch-nn-*.
