INSTALL

For typical Unix-like systems:

	./configure
	make
	[sudo] make install

Installs tools into /usr/local/lib, with libraries and header files in
/usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include respectively.

Typical configure options such as --prefix should work, though little testing
has been done.

The tools installed are:
	teckit_compile
		compiler to create binary mapping tables (.tec) from text files (.map)
	txtconv
		simple tool to apply a mapping to a plain-text file
	sfconv
		tool to apply mappings to a Standard Format file, as specified by
		a control file
