Compiling xpdf
--------------

Xpdf is written in C++ (with a little bit of C).  It should work with
any ANSI-compliant C++ and C compilers.  The systems and compilers
it's been tested with are listed on the xpdf web page.

Xpdf requires the Motif (or Lesstif) toolkit.

The following notes give specific instructions for compiling on
different systems.


**************
***  UNIX  ***
**************

* Install t1lib (if desired).  The resulting library (libt1) and
  include files (t1lib.h and t1libx.h) should be placed somewhere on
  the standard search paths.  Alternatively, when you configure xpdf,
  you can use the following options to tell configure where to find
  the t1lib files:

    --with-t1-library=PATH
    --with-t1-includes=PATH

* Install FreeType 2 (this is required).  WARNING: You must have
  version 2.0.5 or newer.  Some older versions of XFree86 ship with an
  older version of FreeType, which means you'll need to explicitly set
  include and library paths to get the correct version:

    --with-freetype2-library=PATH
    --with-freetype2-includes=PATH

  (The include path is the directory which contains the freetype2
  directory, i.e., do NOT include "freetype2" in the
  --with-freetype2-includes path.  For example, with the default
  installation, the library path is /usr/local/lib and the include
  path is /usr/local/include/freetype2.)

* If you have Motif (or Lesstif) installed in a non-standard place,
  you can use the following options to tell configure where to find
  it:

    --with-Xm-library=PATH
    --with-Xm-includes=PATH

* Run the configure script:

    ./configure

  This should produce a set of makefiles customized for your system.
  The configure script accepts the following options (in addition to
  the usual things accepted by autoconf configure scripts):

    --prefix=PREFIX
        Changes the directory where xpdf is installed.  The default is
        /usr/local.

    --enable-a4-paper
        Switches the default paper size for PostScript output (xpdf
        and pdftops) to A4.  The default is Letter size.

    --enable-no-text-select
        With this option, xpdf will not copy text.  (This is only
        useful on closed systems where the user can't get at the PDF
        file directly.)

    --enable-opi
        Enables support for generation of OPI (Open Prepress
        Interface) comments with pdftops.

    --sysconfdir=DIR
        Look for the system-wide xpdfrc config file in this directory.
        The default is PREFIX/etc.

    --with-appdef-dir=DIR
        Use the specified app-defaults directory.  The default is
        /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.

  If you need to pass specific options to the C and/or C++ compiler,
  you can set the CFLAGS and/or CXXFLAGS environment variables before
  running the configure script.  Any options given that way will be
  added to the CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS used by all of the Xpdf makefiles.

* Type 'make'.  This should build the executables:

    xpdf/xpdf
    xpdf/pdftops
    xpdf/pdftotext
    xpdf/pdfinfo
    xpdf/pdffonts
    xpdf/pdftoppm
    xpdf/pdfimages

* If desired, type 'make install' to install the binaries and man
  pages.

The old Makefile.config and Makefiles are no longer provided or
supported.  If you really want to manually configure Xpdf (which is
not recommended), the files that need to be created are aconf.h,
Makefile, goo/Makefile, fofi/Makefile, splash/Makefile, and
xpdf/Makefile, all of which are generated from the corresponding '.in'
files.

If you want to run a quick test, there is a tiny PDF file included
with xpdf, as misc/hello.pdf .


*************
***  VMS  ***
*************

* The 'stddef.h' include file which comes with older versions of gcc
  may be missing a definition for wchar_t.  In this case, add the
  following lines:
  -----
  File GNU_CC:[INCLUDE]STDDEF.H;2
   44   /* Wide characters, not yet supported by VAXCRTL [match VAXC's <stddef.
   45   #if !defined(_WCHAR_T) && !defined(_WCHAR_T_)
   46   typedef unsigned int wchar_t;
   47   #endif
   48   #define _WCHAR_T
   49   #define _WCHAR_T_
   50
  -----

* Read the instructions at the top of vms_make.com.

* Type '@vms_make' in the top-level directory.  You'll probably want
  to use some of the options described in the file.

* The executables will be left in '[.xpdf]'.

If you want to run a quick test, there is a tiny PDF file included
with xpdf, as misc/hello.pdf .


**************
***  OS/2  ***
**************

Xpdf is known to run under OS/2 with the EMX runtime environment and
XFree86.  Using a proper autoconf port you can generate a valid
configure script version.


***************
***  Win32  ***
***************

The non-X programs (pdftops, pdftotext, pdfinfo, pdffonts, pdfimages,
and pdftoppm) will compile with both gcc (from cygwin), djgpp (the
Delorie port of gcc) and Microsoft Visual C++.

With cygwin, the build procedure is the same as for Unix:

  * Open a shell.

  * ./configure

  * make

  * make install

It is also possible to build the Xpdf viewer with the cygwin XFree86
port (thanks to Michael A. Richmond for these instructions):

  * make sure you have the lesstif, XFree86-base, and XFree86-prog
    cygwin packages installed (all from the "XFree86" category)

  * to build t1lib:
    - cd T1Lib-x.y
    - ./configure --without-x
    - make without_doc
    - make install
    (this should install /usr/local/include/t1lib.h and
    /usr/local/lib/libt1.a)

  * to build xpdf:
    - cd xpdf-x.yy
    - ./configure --with-t1-library=/usr/local/lib
        --with-t1-includes=/usr/local/include
        --with-freetype2-library=/usr/X11R6/lib
        --with-freetype2-includes=/usr/X11R6/include/freetype2
        --with-Xm-library=/usr/X11R6/lib
        --with-Xm-includes=/usr/X11R6/include
      (all on one line)
    - make
    (this should build xpdf.exe, in addition to the command line
    utilities)

With djgpp:

  * Open a DOS window.

  * ./dj_make

  * djgpp is a DOS/Windows port of gcc, available from
    http://www.delorie.com/

With djgpp, for DOS 6 (instead of Win32):

  * ./dj_make

  * cd xpdf

  * strip pdftops.exe

  * exe2coff pdftops.exe

  * copy /B c:\djgpp\bin\cwsdstub.exe+pdftops pdftops.exe

  * upx pdftops.exe
    - if you want compressed executables

  * and similarly for the other executables

  * cwsdstub.exe comes from djgpp/v2misc/csdpmi5b.zip on any of the
    djgpp ftp mirrors; exe2coff is part of the standard djgpp install

  * upx comes from http://upx.sourceforge.net/

With the Microsoft tools:

  * Open a DOS window.

  * Type "cl".  If you get the message "Bad command or file name", you
    must run VCVARS32.BAT. (The location of this BAT file can be
    determined with Explorer.)

  * Type "ms_make"

The dj_make and ms_make scripts don't build pdftoppm -- you'll need to
install t1lib and FreeType 2 before you can compile pdftoppm.
