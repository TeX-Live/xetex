Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 3.01 - a PDF viewer for X


Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer for X.  The Xpdf
project also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript
converter, and various other utilities.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.  The non-X
components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32 systems and
should run on pretty much any system with a decent C++ compiler.

Major changes:
* Added the continuous view mode, including the '-cont' switch and the
  'continuousView' config file option.
* At high zoom levels, don't rasterize the entire page - this avoids
  problems running out of memory.
* Added "search backward" and "match case" options to the find dialog.
* Support explicitly masked images and soft masked images.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, OS/2, and Win32.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:
