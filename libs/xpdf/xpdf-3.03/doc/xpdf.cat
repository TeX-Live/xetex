NAME
       xpdf - Portable Document Format (PDF) file viewer for X (version 3.03)

SYNOPSIS
       xpdf [options] [PDF-file [page | +dest]]

DESCRIPTION
       Xpdf  is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.  (These are
       also sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from the  name  of  Adobe's
       PDF  software.)   Xpdf runs under the X Window System on UNIX, VMS, and
       OS/2.

       To run xpdf, simply type:

              xpdf file.pdf

       where file.pdf is your PDF file.  The file name can be  followed  by  a
       number specifying the page which should be displayed first, e.g.:

              xpdf file.pdf 18

       You  can  also  give a named destination, prefixed with '+' in place of
       the page number.  (This is only useful  with  PDF  files  that  provide
       named destination targets.)

       You can also start xpdf without opening any files:

              xpdf

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Xpdf reads a configuration file at startup.  It first tries to find the
       user's private config file, ~/.xpdfrc.  If that doesn't exist, it looks
       for  a  system-wide  config  file, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc (but
       this location can be changed when xpdf is built).   See  the  xpdfrc(5)
       man page for details.

OPTIONS
       Many  of  the following options can be set with configuration file com-
       mands or X resources.  These are listed in  square  brackets  with  the
       description of the corresponding command line option.

       -g geometry
              Set the initial window geometry.  (-geometry is equivalent.)  [X
              resource: xpdf.geometry]

       -title title
              Set the window title.  By default,  the  title  will  be  "xpdf:
              foo.pdf".  [X resource: xpdf.title]

       -cmap  Install  a private colormap.  This is ignored on TrueColor visu-
              als.  [X resource: xpdf.installCmap]

       -rgb number
              Set the size of largest RGB cube xpdf will try to allocate.  The
              default is 5 (for a 5x5x5 cube); set to a smaller number to con-
              serve color table entries.  This is ignored  with  private  col-
              ormaps and on TrueColor visuals.  [X resource: xpdf.rgbCubeSize]

       -rv    Set reverse video mode.  This reverses the colors of  everything
              except  images.  It may not always produce great results for PDF
              files which do weird things with color.  This  also  causes  the
              paper  color  to  default to black.  [X resource: xpdf.reverseV-
              ideo]

       -papercolor color
              Set the "paper color", i.e., the background of the page display.
              This  will  not work too well with PDF files that do things like
              filling in white behind the text.  [X resource: xpdf.paperColor]

       -mattecolor color
              Set the matte color, i.e., the color used for background outside
              the  actual  page  area.   (There   is   a   separate   setting,
              xpdf.fullScreenMatteColor,  for full-screen mode.)  [X resource:
              xpdf.matteColor]

       -z zoom
              Set the initial zoom factor.  A number specifies a zoom percent-
              age,  where  100  means 72 dpi.  You may also specify 'page', to
              fit the page to the window size, or 'width',  to  fit  the  page
              width  to  the  window  width.   [config file: initialZoom; or X
              resource: xpdf.initialZoom]

       -cont  Start in continuous view mode, i.e., with  one  vertical  scroll
              bar for the whole document.  [config file: continuousView]

       -t1lib yes | no
              Enable  or  disable  t1lib  (a  Type  1  font rasterizer).  This
              defaults to "yes".  [config file: enableT1lib]

       -freetype yes | no
              Enable or disable FreeType (a TrueType /  Type  1  font  raster-
              izer).  This defaults to "yes".  [config file: enableFreeType]

       -aa yes | no
              Enable  or  disable font anti-aliasing.  This defaults to "yes".
              [config file: antialias]

       -aaVector yes | no
              Enable or disable vector anti-aliasing.  This defaults to "yes".
              [config file: vectorAntialias]

       -ps PS-file
              Set  the default file name for PostScript output (i.e., the name
              which will appear in the print dialog).  This can also be of the
              form '|command' to pipe the PostScript through a command.  [con-
              fig file: psFile]

       -paper size
              Set the paper size to one of "letter", "legal", "A4",  or  "A3".
              This  can  also be set to "match", which will set the paper size
              to match the size specified in  the  PDF  file.   [config  file:
              psPaperSize]

       -paperw size
              Set the paper width, in points.  [config file: psPaperSize]

       -paperh size
              Set the paper height, in points.  [config file: psPaperSize]

       -level1
              Generate  Level  1  PostScript.   The resulting PostScript files
              will be significantly larger (if they contain images), but  will
              print  on  Level  1  printers.  This also converts all images to
              black and white.  [config file: psLevel]

       -enc encoding-name
              Sets the encoding to use for  text  output.   The  encoding-name
              must  be  defined  with  the unicodeMap command (see xpdfrc(5)).
              This defaults to "Latin1" (which is a built-in encoding).  [con-
              fig file: textEncoding]

       -eol unix | dos | mac
              Sets the end-of-line convention to use for text output.  [config
              file: textEOL]

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the  PDF  file.   Providing  this
              will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -fullscreen
              Open xpdf in full-screen mode, useful for presentations.

       -remote name
              Start/contact  xpdf  remote  server with specified name (see the
              REMOTE SERVER MODE section below).

       -exec command
              Execute a command (see the COMMANDS section below)  in  an  xpdf
              remote server window (with -remote only).

       -reload
              Reload xpdf remote server window (with -remote only).

       -raise Raise xpdf remote server window (with -remote only).

       -quit  Kill xpdf remote server (with -remote only).

       -cmd   Print  commands  as  they're  executed  (useful  for debugging).
              [config file: printCommands]

       -q     Don't print any messages or errors.  [config file: errQuiet]

       -cfg config-file
              Read config-file in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the system-wide config
              file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.  (-help and --help are equivalent.)

       Several other standard X options and resources will work as expected:

       -display display
              [X resource: xpdf.display]

       -fg color
              (-foreground is equivalent.)  [X resource: xpdf*Foreground]

       -bg color
              (-background is equivalent.)  [X resource: xpdf*Background]

       -font font
              (-fn is equivalent.)  [X resource: xpdf*fontList]

       The color and font options only affect the user interface elements, not
       the PDF display (the 'paper').

       The following X resources do not have command line option equivalents:

       xpdf.toolTipEnable
              Enables (if set to true) or disables (if set to false) the tool-
              tips on the toolbar buttons.

       xpdf.fullScreenMatteColor
              Sets  the  matte  color  to  be  used  in full-screen mode.  The
              default setting is "black".

CONTROLS

       left/right arrow buttons
              Move to the previous/next page.

       double left/right arrow buttons
              Move backward or forward by ten pages.

       dashed left/right arrow buttons
              Move backward or forward along the history path.

       'Page' entry box
              Move to a specific page number.  Click in the  box  to  activate
              it, type the page number, then hit return.

       zoom popup menu
              Change  the  zoom  factor  (see the description of the -z option
              above).

       binoculars button
              Find a text string.

       print button
              Bring up a dialog for generating a PostScript file.  The  dialog
              has  options  to  set the pages to be printed and the PostScript
              file name.  The file name can be '-' for stdout or '|command' to
              pipe the PostScript through a command, e.g., '|lpr'.

       '?' button
              Bring up the 'about xpdf' window.

       link info
              The space between the '?' and 'Quit' buttons is used to show the
              URL or external file name when the mouse is over a link.

       'Quit' button
              Quit xpdf.


   Menu
       Pressing the right mouse button will post a popup menu with the follow-
       ing commands:

       Open...
              Open a new PDF file via a file requester.

       Open in new window...
              Create  a  new  window  and  open  a  new  PDF  file  via a file
              requester.

       Reload Reload the current PDF file.  Note that  Xpdf  will  reload  the
              file  automatically  (on  a  page  change  or  redraw) if it has
              changed since it was last loaded.

       Save as...
              Save the current file via a file requester.

       Continuous view
              Toggles between single page and continuous view modes.

       Rotate counterclockwise
              Rotate the page 90 degrees counterclockwise.

       Rotate clockwise
              Rotate the page 90 degrees clockwise.  The two  rotate  commands
              are  intended  primarily  for PDF files where the rotation isn't
              correctly specified in the file.

       Zoom to selection
              Zoom in to the currently selected rectangle.

       Close  Close the current window.  If this is the only open window,  the
              document is closed, but the window is left open (i.e., this menu
              command won't quit xpdf).

       Quit   Quit xpdf.


   Outline
       If the PDF contains an outline (a.k.a., bookmarks), there  will  be  an
       outline  pane on the left side of the window.  The width of the outline
       pane is adjustable with a vertical split bar via the knob near its bot-
       tom end.


   Text selection
       Dragging  the  mouse  with  the left button held down will highlight an
       arbitrary rectangle.  Any text inside this rectangle will be copied  to
       the X selection buffer.


   Links
       Clicking on a hyperlink will jump to the link's destination.  A link to
       another PDF document will make xpdf load  that  document.   A  'launch'
       link  to  an executable program will display a dialog, and if you click
       'ok', execute the program.  URL links call an external command (see the
       WEB BROWSERS section below).


   Panning
       Dragging the mouse with the middle button held down pans the window.


   Key bindings
       o      Open a new PDF file via a file requester.

       r      Reload  the  current  PDF  file.  Note that Xpdf will reload the
              file automatically (on a  page  change  or  redraw)  if  it  has
              changed since it was last loaded.

WEB BROWSERS
       If  you  want  to  run  xpdf automatically from netscape or mosaic (and
       probably other browsers) when you click on a link to a  PDF  file,  you
       need  to  edit  (or  create) the files .mime.types and .mailcap in your
       home directory.  In .mime.types add the line:

              application/pdf pdf

       In .mailcap add the lines:

              # Use xpdf to view PDF files.
              application/pdf; xpdf -q %s

       Make sure that xpdf is on your executable search path.

       When you click on a URL link in a PDF file, xpdf will execute the  com-
       mand  specified  by  the  urlCommand  config  file option, replacing an
       occurrence of '%s' with the URL.  For example, to  call  netscape  with
       the URL, add this line to your config file:

              urlCommand "netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'"

COMMANDS
       Xpdf's key and mouse bindings are user-configurable, using the bind and
       unbind options in the config file (see xpdfrc(5)).   The  bind  command
       allows  you  to bind a key or mouse button to a sequence of one or more
       commands.

   Available Commands
       The following commands are supported:

       gotoPage(page)
              Go to the specified page.

           bind P              scrLockOff  prevPage
           bind p              scrLockOn   prevPageNoScroll
           bind P              scrLockOn   prevPageNoScroll

           bind Q              any         quit

       Previous  versions  of  xpdf  included a "viKeys" X resource.  It is no
       longer available, but the following bindings are equivalent:

           bind h any scrollLeft(16)
           bind l any scrollRight(16)
           bind k any scrollUp(16)
           bind j any scrollDown(16)


REMOTE SERVER MODE
       Xpdf can be started in remote server mode by specifying a  server  name
       (in addition to the file name and page number).  For example:

              xpdf -remote myServer file.pdf

       If  there  is  currently  no  xpdf running in server mode with the name
       'myServer', a new xpdf window will be opened.  If another command:

              xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 9

       is issued, a new copy of xpdf will not be started.  Instead, the  first
       xpdf  (the server) will load another.pdf and display page nine.  If the
       file name is the same:

              xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 4

       the xpdf server will simply display the specified page.

       The -raise option tells the server to raise its window; it can be spec-
       ified with or without a file name and page number.

       The -quit option tells the server to close its window and exit.

EXIT CODES
       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
