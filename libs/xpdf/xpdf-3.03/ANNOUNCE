Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 3.03 - a PDF viewer for X


Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer for X.  The Xpdf
project also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript
converter, and various other utilities.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.  The non-X
components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32 systems and
should run on pretty much any system with a decent C++ compiler.

Major changes:
* Added the "fixed pitch" text extraction mode.
* Modified "pdftops -paper match" to handle PDF files with
  different-sized pages, i.e., it will now select the matching paper
  size on a page-by-page basis.
* Add ability for pdftoppm to write to stdout.
* Added the pdfdetach tool.
* Implemented 256-bit AES decryption.
* Commented out the t1lib section in the configure script -- t1lib has
  some potential security holes, and hasn't been updated in years.
* Redesigned the font configuration xpdfrc commands: removed the
  displayFontT1, displayFontTT, displayNamedCIDFontT1,
  displayCIDFontT1, displayNamedCIDFontTT, displayCIDFontTT, psFont,
  psNamedFont16, and psFont16 commands; added the fontFile,
  fontFileCC, psResidentFont, psResidentFont16, and psResidentFontCC
  commands.
* Switched from GPLv2 to dual v2/v3 licensing.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, OS/2, and Win32.
