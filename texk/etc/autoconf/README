These files make up a complete installation of the data files for
autoconf, autoconf, except that none have been "frozen".  This
directory must be given as the -m argument for autoconf to work
correctly, as the standard 2.13 distribution contains some bugs
that we work around, and lacks some features that we need.

If another version of Autoconf is released, it may or may not
include some or all of these changes (all have been reported to
the autoconf maintainer).  It's not under our control.

The changed files are
	acgeneral.m4
	acspecific.m4
while
	acsite.m4
has been added.
