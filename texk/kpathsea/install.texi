@cindex installation, simple

@cindex precompiled executables, instead of installation
@cindex installation, getting executables instead of
Installing @TeX{} and friends for the first time can be a daunting
experience.  Thus, you may prefer to skip this whole thing and just get
precompiled executables: see @ref{unixtex.ftp}.

This section explains what to do if you wish to take the defaults for
everything, and generally to install in the simplest possible way.  Most
steps here refer to corresponding subsection in the next section which
explains how to override defaults and generally gives more details.

By default everything will be installed under @file{/usr/local} and the
following discussion assumes this.  However, if you already have @TeX{}
installed, its location is used to derive the directory under which
everything is to be installed.

@enumerate
@item
Be sure you have enough disk space: approximately 8 megabytes for the
compressed archives, 15MB for sources, 50MB for compilation, 40MB for
the (initial) installed system (including library files).  @xref{Disk
space}.

@item
Retrieve these distribution archives:
@table @url
@item ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/texk.tar.gz
These are the sources, which you will be compiling. 

@item ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/texklib.tar.gz
This is a basic set of input files.  You should unpack it in the
directory @file{/usr/local/share}; doing so will create a @file{texmf}
subdirectory there.
@end table

These archives are mirrored on the CTAN hosts, in the
@file{systems/web2c} directory.

@noindent @xref{Kpathsea application distributions}.

@item
When using the default search paths, there is no need to edit any
distribution files. @xref{Changing search paths}.

@item
At the top level of the distribution, run @samp{sh configure}.  (If you
have the GNU Bash shell installed, run @samp{bash configure}.)
@xref{Running configure}.

@item
@samp{make}. @xref{Running make}.  If you are using a BSD 4.4 system
such as FreeBSD or NetBSD, you may have to use GNU make (often installed
in @file{/usr/local/bin}), not the BSD make.

@item 
@samp{make install}. @xref{Installing files}.

@item
@samp{make distclean}. @xref{Cleaning up}.

@item
Set up a cron job to rebuild the filename database that makes searching
faster.  This line will rebuild it every midnight:
@example
0 0 * * * cd /usr/local/share/texmf && @var{/bindir}/mktexlsr
@end example
@xref{Filename database generation}, and @ref{Filename database}.

@item
@cindex printer configuration files
@cindex PostScript fonts, additional
@cindex color printers, configuring
If you're installing Dvips, you also need to set up configuration files
for your printers and make any additional PostScript fonts available.
@xref{Installation,,, dvips, Dvips}.  If you have any color printers,
see @ref{Color device configuration,,, dvips, Dvips}.

@item
The first time you run a DVI driver, a bunch of PK fonts will be built
by Metafont via @code{mktexpk} (and added to the filename database).
This will take some time.  Don't be alarmed; they will created only this
first time (unless something is wrong with your path definitions).

By default, @code{mktexpk} will create these fonts in a hierarchy
under @file{/var/tmp/texfonts}; it simply assumes that @file{/var/tmp}
exists and is globally writable.  If you need a different arrangement,
see @ref{mktex configuration}.

Most sites need to modify the default installation procedure in some

@subsection Changing search paths

@cindex search paths, changing default
@cindex paths, changing default
@flindex texmf.in@r{, editing}
If the search paths for your installation differ from the standard
@TeX{} directory structure (@pxref{Top,, Introduction, tds, A Directory
Structure for @TeX{} files}), edit the file @file{kpathsea/texmf.in}
as desired, before running @code{configure}.  For example, if you have
all your fonts or macros in one big directory.

You may also wish to edit the file @file{mktex.cnf}, either before or
after installation, to control various aspects of @code{mktexpk} and
friends.  @xref{mktex configuration}.

You do not need to edit @file{texmf.in} to change the default
top-level or other installation @emph{directories} (only the paths).
You can and should do that when you run @code{configure} (next step).

You also do not need to edit @file{texmf.in} if you are willing to
rely on @file{texmf.cnf} at runtime to define the paths, and let the
compile-time default paths be incorrect.  Usually there is no harm in
doing this.

The section below explains default generation in more detail.

@menu
* Default path features::       
* Default path generation::     
@end menu


@node Default path features
@subsubsection Default path features

@cindex default path features
@cindex features, of default paths

The purpose of having all the different files described in the section
above is to avoid having the same information in more than one place. If
you change the installation directories or top-level prefix at
@code{configure}-time, those changes will propagate through the whole
sequence.  And if you change the default paths in @file{texmf.in},
those changes are propagated to the compile-time defaults.

The Make definitions are all repeated in several @t{Makefile}'s; but
changing the top-level @file{Makefile} should suffice, as it passes down
all the variable definitions, thus overriding the submakes.  (The
definitions are repeated so you can run Make in the subdirectories, if
you should have occasion to.)

@vindex MAKETEX_MODE
@cindex paths, device name included in
By default, the bitmap font paths end with @samp{/$MAKETEX_MODE}, thus
including the device name (usually a Metafont mode name such as
@samp{ljfour}).  This distinguishes two different devices with the same
resolution---a write/white from a write/black 300@dmn{dpi} printer, for
example.

@findex kpse_init_prog@r{, and @code{MAKETEX_MODE}}
@flindex proginit.c
However, since most sites don't have this complication, Kpathsea
(specifically, the @code{kpse_init_prog} function in
@file{kpathsea/proginit.c}) has a special case: if the mode has not been
explicitly set by the user (or in a configuration file), it sets
@code{MAKETEX_MODE} to @code{/}.  This makes the default PK path, for
example, expand into @code{@dots{}/pk//}, so fonts will be found even if
there is no subdirectory for the mode (if you arranged things that way
because your site has only one printer, for example) or if the program
is mode-independent (e.g., @code{pktype}).

To make the paths independent of the mode, simply edit
@file{texmf.in} before installation, or the installed
@file{texmf.cnf}, and remove the @samp{$MAKETEX_MODE}.

@node Default path generation
@subsubsection Default path generation

@cindex default paths, changing
@cindex paths, changing default
@cindex installation, changing default directories
@cindex directories, changing default installation

This section describes how the default paths are constructed.

You may wish to ignore the whole mess and simply edit @file{texmf.cnf}
after it is installed, perhaps even copying it into place beforehand so
you can complete the installation, if it seems necessary.

@cindex default paths, how they're made
To summarize the chain of events that go into defining the default paths:

@enumerate
@item
@samp{configure} creates a @file{Makefile} from each @file{Makefile.in}.

@item
@flindex texmf.sed
When Make runs in the @file{kpathsea} directory, it creates a file
@file{texmf.sed} that substitutes the Make value of @code{$(var)} for a
string @code{@@var@@}.  The variables in question are the one that
define the installation directories.

@item
@flindex texmf.in
@flindex texmf.cnf@r{, generated}
@file{texmf.sed} (together with a little extra magic---see
@file{kpathsea/Makefile}) is applied to @file{texmf.in} to generate
@file{texmf.cnf}.  This is the file that will eventually be installed
and used.

@item
@flindex paths.h
The definitions in @file{texmf.cnf} are recast as C @code{#define}'s in
@file{paths.h}.  These values will be the compile-time defaults; they
are not used at runtime unless no @file{texmf.cnf} file can be found.

(That's a lie: the compile-time defaults are what any extra @t{:}'s in
@file{texmf.cnf} expand into; but the paths as distributed have no extra
@t{:}'s, and there's no particular reason for them to.)

@code{configure} adapts the source distribution to the present system

Options to give the compiler: default is @samp{-g -O2} for @code{gcc},
@samp{-g} otherwise.  @code{CFLAGS} comes after any other options.  You
may need to include @code{-w} here if your compilations commonly have
useless warnings (e.g., @code{NULL redefined}), or @code{configure} may
fail to detect the presence of header files (it takes the messages on
standard error to mean the header file doesn't exist).

@item CPPFLAGS
@cindex configuration compiler options
Options to pass to the compiler preprocessor; this matters most for
configuration, not the actual source compilation.  The @code{configure}
script often does only preprocessing (e.g., to check for the existence
of @t{#include} files), and @code{CFLAGS} is not used for this.  You may
need to set this to something like
@samp{-I/usr/local/include/wwwhatever} if you have the libwww library
installed for hyper-xdvik (see @file{xdvik/INSTALL}).

@item DEFS
@cindex preprocessor options
Additional preprocessor options, but not used by @code{configure}.
Provided for enabling or disabling program features, as documented in

@node Shared library
@subsubsection Shared library

@cindex shared library, making

@opindex --enable-shared
You can compile Kpathsea as a shared library on a few systems, by
specifying the option @samp{--enable-shared} when you run
@samp{configure}.

@cindex code sharing
The main advantage in doing this is that the executables can then share
the code, thus decreasing memory and disk space requirements.

On some systems, you can record the location of shared libraries in a
binary, usually by giving certain options to the linker.  Then
individual users do not need to set their system's environment variable
(e.g., @code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}) to find shared libraries.  If you want to
do this, you will need to add the necessary options to @code{LDFLAGS}
yourself; for example, on Solaris, include something like
@samp{-R$@{prefix@}/lib}, on IRIX or Linux, use
@samp{-rpath$@{prefix@}/lib}.  (Unfortunately, making this happen by
default is very difficult, because of interactions with an existing
installed shared library.)

@cindex fallback resolutions, overriding
You can override directory names and other values at @code{make}-time.
@file{make/paths.make} lists the variables most commonly reset.  For
example, @samp{make default_texsizes=600} changes the list of fallback
resolutions.

You can also override each of @code{configure}'s environment variables
(@pxref{configure environment}).  The Make variables have the same names.

Finally, you can supply additional options via the following variables.
(@code{configure} does not use these.)

@cindex compiler, changing
@cindex libraries, changing

@flindex libucb@r{, avoiding}
@flindex ucbinclude@r{, avoiding}
Adding compiler options to change the ``universe'' you are using
(typically BSD vs.@: system V) is generally a cause of trouble.  It's
best to use the native environment, whatever that is; @code{configure}
and the software usually adapt best to that.  In particular, under
Solaris 2.x, you should not use the BSD-compatibility library
(@file{libucb}) or include files (@file{ucbinclude}).

@cindex Babel
If you want to use the Babel La@TeX{} package for support of non-English
typesetting, you need to modify some files before making the La@TeX{}
format.  See the file @file{install.txt} in the Babel distribution.


@node Installing files
@subsection Installing files

@cindex installing files

The basic command is the usual @code{make install}.  For security
issues, @pxref{Security}.

The first time you install any manual in the GNU Info system, you should
add a line (you choose where) to the file @file{dir} in your
@samp{$(infodir)} directory.  Sample text for this is given near the top
of the Texinfo source files (@file{kpathsea/kpathsea.texi},
@file{dvipsk/dvips.texi}, and @file{web2c/doc/web2c.texi}).
If you have a recent version of the GNU Texinfo distribution installed
(@url{ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/texinfo-3.9.tar.gz} or later), this
should happen automatically.

On the offchance that this is your first Info installation, the
@file{dir} file I use is included in the distribution as
@file{etc/dir-example}.

@cindex multiple architectures, installing on
@cindex architecture-(in)dependent files, installing only
@cindex installation, architecture-(in)dependent files only
You may wish to use one of the following targets, especially if you are
installing on multiple architectures:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@findex install-exec @r{Make target}
@code{make install-exec} to install in architecture-dependent
directories, i.e., ones that depend on the @code{$(exec_prefix)} Make
variable.  This includes links to binaries, libraries, etc., not just
``executables''.

@item
@findex install-data @r{Make target}
@code{make install-data} to install in architecture-independent
directories, such as documentation, configuration files, pool files, etc.
@end itemize

@cindex AFS
@cindex Andrew File System, installing with
@flindex /afs/@dots{} @r{, installing into}
If you use the Andrew File System, the normal path (e.g.,
@var{prefix}/bin) only gets you to a read-only copy of the files, and
you must specify a different path for installation.  The best way to do this
is by setting the @samp{prefix} variable on the @code{make} command
line.  The sequence becomes something like this:
@example
configure --prefix=/whatever
make
make install prefix=/afs/.@var{system.name}/system/1.3/@@sys/whatever
@end example
@flindex ls-R @r{and AFS}
@cindex relative filenames in @file{ls-R}
@noindent With AFS, you will definitely want to use relative filenames in 
@file{ls-R} (@pxref{Filename database}), not absolute filenames.  This
is done by default, but check anyway.


@node Cleaning up
@subsection Cleaning up

@findex distclean @r{Make target}
The basic command is @code{make distclean}.  This removes all files
created by the build.

Alternatively,
@itemize @bullet
@item
@findex mostlyclean @r{Make target}
@code{make mostlyclean} if you intend to compile on another
architecture.  For Web2C, since the generated C files are portable,
they are not removed.  If the @code{lex} vs.@: @code{flex} situation
is going to be different on the next machine, @code{rm
web2c/lex.yy.c}.

@item
@findex clean @r{Make target}
@code{make clean} to remove files created by compiling, but leave
configuration files and Makefiles.

@item
@findex maintainer-clean @r{Make target}
@code{make maintainer-clean} to remove everything that the Makefiles can
rebuild.  This is more than @samp{distclean} removes, and you should
only use it if you are thoroughly conversant with (and have the necessary
versions of) Autoconf.

@item
@findex extraclean @r{Make target}
@code{make extraclean} to remove other junk, e.g., core files, log
files, patch rejects.  This is independent of the other @samp{clean}
targets.
@end itemize


@node Filename database generation
@subsection Filename database generation

@cindex filename database generation
@cindex generation of filename database

You will probably want to set up a @code{cron} entry on the appropriate
machine(s) to rebuild the filename database nightly or so, as in:
@example
0 0 * * * cd @var{texmf} && @var{/bindir}/mktexlsr
@end example
@noindent @xref{Filename database}.

Although the @code{mktex@dots{}} scripts make every effort to add
newly-created files on the fly, it can't hurt to make sure you get a
fresh version every so often.


@node mktex scripts
@subsection @file{mktex} scripts

@cindex @file{mktex} scripts
@cindex scripts for file creation

@cindex font set, infinite
@cindex dynamic creation of files
@cindex Sauter fonts, and dynamic source creation
@cindex EC fonts, and dynamic source creation
If Kpathsea cannot otherwise find a file, for some file types it is
configured by default to invoke an external program to create it
dynamically (@pxref{mktex configuration}).  These are collectively
known as @dfn{@code{mktex} scripts}, since most of them are named
@code{mktex...}.

For example, this is useful for fonts (bitmaps, TFM's, and
arbitrarily-sizable Metafont sources such as the Sauter and EC fonts),
since any given document can use fonts never before referenced.
Building all fonts in advance is therefore impractical, if not
impossible.

It is also useful for the @TeX{} @samp{.fmt} (and Metafont
@samp{.base} and Metapost @samp{.mem} files, @pxref{Memory
dumps,,,Web2c,web2c}), where pre-generating every format consumes a
lot of both time and space.

The script is passed the name of the file to create and possibly other
arguments, as explained below.  It must echo the full pathname of the
file it created (and nothing else) to standard output; it can write
diagnostics to standard error.

@menu
* config: mktex configuration.
* names: mktex script names.
* args: mktex script arguments.
@end menu


@node mktex configuration
@subsubsection @file{mktex} configuration

@cindex @file{mktex} script configuration
@cindex configuration of @file{mktex} scripts
@cindex enabling @file{mktex} scripts
@cindex disabling @file{mktex} scripts

The list of file types and program names that can run an external
program to create missing files is listed in the next section.  In the
absence of @code{configure} options specifying otherwise, everything
but @file{mktextex} will be enabled by default.  The @code{configure}
options to change the defaults are:

@cindex @code{configure} options for @file{mktex} scripts
@opindex --without-mktexfmt-default
@opindex --without-mktexmf-default
@opindex --without-mktexocp-default
@opindex --without-mktexofm-default
@opindex --without-mktexpk-default
@opindex --without-mktextfm-default
@opindex --with-mktextex-default
@example
--without-mktexfmt-default
--without-mktexmf-default
--without-mktexocp-default
--without-mktexofm-default
--without-mktexpk-default
--without-mktextfm-default
--with-mktextex-default
@end example

The @code{configure} setting is overridden if the environment variable
or configuration file value named for the script is set; e.g.,
@file{MKTEXPK} (@pxref{mktex script arguments}).

@flindex fmtutils.cnf
@code{mktexfmt} reads a file @file{fmtutil.cnf}, typically located in
@file{texmf/web2c/} to glean its configuration information.  The rest
of the files and features in this section are primarily intended for
the font generation scripts.

@flindex mktex.cnf
@flindex mktex.opt
@cindex site overrides for @code{mktex@dots{}}
As distributed, all the scripts source a file
@file{texmf/web2c/mktex.cnf} if it exists, so you can override various
defaults.  
See @file{mktex.opt}, for instance, which defines the default mode,
resolution, some special directory names, etc.  If you prefer not to
change the distributed scripts, you can simply create @file{mktex.cnf}
with the appropriate definitions (you do not need to create it if you
have nothing to put in it).  @file{mktex.cnf} has no special syntax;
it's an arbitrary Bourne shell script.  The distribution contains a
sample @file{mktex.cnf} for you to copy and modify as you please (it
is not installed anywhere).

@flindex mktex.opt
@vindex MT_FEATURES
In addition, you can configure a number of features with the
@code{MT_FEATURES} variable, which you can define:

@itemize @bullet
@item
in @file{mktex.opt}, as just mentioned;

@item
by editing the file @file{mktex.opt}, either before @samp{make
install} (in the source hierarchy) or after (in the installed
hierarchy);

@item
or in the environment.
@end itemize

If none of the options below are enabled, @code{mktexpk},
@code{mktextfm}, and @code{mktexmf} follow the following procedure to
decide where fonts should be installed.  Find the tree where the font's
sources are, and test the permissions of the @samp{fonts} directory of
that tree to determine whether it is writable.  If it is, put the files
in the tree in appropriate locations.  If it isn't writable, see whether
the tree is a system tree (named in @code{SYSTEXMF}).  If so, the
@code{VARTEXFONTS} tree is used.  In all other cases the working
directory is used.

The @samp{appendonlydir} option is enabled by default.

@vtable @samp
@item appendonlydir
@cindex directories, making append-only
@flindex mktexdir
Tell @code{mktexdir} to create directories append-only, i.e., set
their sticky bit (@pxref{Mode Structure,,, coreutils, GNU Core
Utilities}).  This feature is silently ignored on non-Unix platforms
(e.g. Windows/NT and MS-DOS) which don't support similar functionality.
This feature is enabled by default.

@item dosnames
@cindex 8.3 filenames, using
@cindex DOS compatible names
@flindex dpi@var{nnn} directories
Use 8.3 names; e.g., @file{dpi600/cmr10.pk} instead of
@file{cmr10.600pk}.  Note that this feature only affects filenames that
would otherwise clash with other TeX-related filenames; @file{mktex}
scripts do nothing about filenames which exceed the 8+3 MS-DOS limits
but remain unique when truncated (by the OS) to these limits, and nether
do the scripts care about possible clashes with files which aren't
related with TeX.  For example, @file{cmr10.600pk} would clash with
@file{cmr10.600gf} and is therefore changed when @samp{dosnames} is in
effect, but @file{mf.pool} and @file{mp.base} don't clash with any
TeX-related files and are therefore unchanged.

This feature is turned on by default on MS-DOS.  If you do not wish
@samp{dosnames} to be set on an MS-DOS platform, you need to set the
@code{MT_FEATURES} environment variable to a value that doesn't include
@samp{dosnames}.  You can also change the default setting by editing
@file{mktex.opt}, but only if you use the @file{mktex} shell scripts;
the emulation programs don't consult @file{mktex.opt}.

@item fontmaps
@cindex fontmaps
@cindex fontname
Instead of deriving the location of a font in the destination tree from
the location of the sources, the aliases and directory names from the
Fontname distribution are used. (@pxref{Top,, Introduction, fontname,
Fontname}).

@item nomfdrivers
@cindex metafont driver files
Let mktexpk and mktextfm create metafont driver files in a temporary
directory.  These will be used for just one metafont run and not
installed permanently.

@item nomode
@cindex mode directory, omitting
Omit the directory level for the mode name; this is fine as long as
you generate fonts for only one mode.

@item stripsupplier
@cindex supplier directory, omitting
Omit the font supplier name directory level.

@item striptypeface
@cindex typeface directory, omitting
Omit the font typeface name directory level.

@item strip
@cindex supplier directory, omitting
@cindex typeface directory, omitting
Omit the font supplier and typeface name directory levels.  This feature
is deprecated in favour of @samp{stripsupplier} and @samp{striptypeface}.

@item varfonts
@flindex /var/tmp/texfonts
@vindex VARTEXFONTS
@cindex Linux File System Standard
When this option is enabled, fonts that would otherwise be written in
system texmf tree go to the @code{VARTEXFONTS} tree instead.  The
default value in @file{kpathsea/Makefile.in} is
@file{/var/tmp/texfonts}.  The @cite{Linux File System Standard}
recommends @file{/var/tex/fonts}.

@vindex USE_VARTEXFONTS
The @samp{varfonts} setting in @code{MT_FEATURES} is overridden by the
@code{USE_VARTEXFONTS} environment variable: if set to @samp{1}, the
feature is enabled, and if set to @samp{0}, the feature is disabled.

@item texmfvar
@vindex TEXMFVAR
Force generated files that would go into a system tree (as defined by
@code{SYSTEXMF}) into @code{TEXMFVAR}. Starting with te@TeX{}-3.0, the
variable @code{TEXMFVAR} is always set.  The @samp{varfonts} feature takes
precedence if also set.

@vindex USE_TEXMFVAR
The @samp{texmfvar} setting in @code{MT_FEATURES} is overridden by the
@code{USE_TEXMFVAR} environment variable: if set to @samp{1}, the
feature is enabled, and if set to @samp{0}, the feature is disabled.

@cindex names for @file{mktex} scripts

The following table shows the default name of the script for each
of the file types which support runtime generation.

@table @file
@item mktexfmt
@pindex mktexfmt
@pindex fmtutil
(@samp{.fmt}, @samp{.base}, @samp{.mem}) @TeX{}/Metafont/MetaPost
formats.  This script is also named @command{fmtutil}, and reads
@file{fmtutil.cnf} for configuration information.

@item mktexmf
@pindex mktexmf
(@samp{.mf}) Metafont input files.

@item mkocp
@pindex mkocp
(@samp{.ocp}) Omega compiled process files.

@item mkofm
@pindex mkofm
(@samp{.ofm}) Omega font metric files.

@item mktexpk
@pindex mktexpk
(@samp{pk}) Glyph fonts.

@item mktextex
@pindex mktextex
(@samp{.tex}) @TeX{} input files (disabled by default).

@item mktextfm
@pindex mktextfm
(@samp{.tfm}) TFM files.
@end table

@vindex DVIPSMAKEPK
@vindex XDVIMAKEPK
@vindex DVILJMAKEPK
@noindent These names can be overridden by an environment variable specific
to the program---for example, @code{DVIPSMAKEPK} for Dvipsk.

@comment next two paragraphs are repeated in dvips.texi
@flindex missfont.log
@cindex failed @code{mktex@dots{}} script invocation
If a @code{mktex@dots{}} script fails, the invocation is appended to a
file @file{missfont.log} (by default) in the current directory.  You can
then execute the log file to create the missing files after fixing the
problem.

@vindex TEXMFOUTPUT
@vindex MISSFONT_LOG
If the current directory is not writable and the environment variable or
configuration file value @code{TEXMFOUTPUT} is set, its value is
used.  Otherwise, nothing is written.  The name @samp{missfont.log} is
overridden by the @code{MISSFONT_LOG} environment variable or
configuration file value.


@node mktex script arguments
@subsubsection @file{mktex} script arguments

@cindex arguments to @file{mktex}

The first argument to a @file{mktex} script is always the name
of the file to be created.

In the default @file{mktexpk} implementation, additional arguments may
also be passed:

@table @samp
@item --dpi @var{num}
Sets the resolution of the generated font to @var{num}.
@item --mfmode @var{name}
Sets the Metafont mode to @var{name}.
@item --bdpi @var{num}
Sets the the ``base dpi'' for the font.  This must match the mode being
used.
@item --mag @var{string}
A ``magstep'' string suitable for the Metafont @code{mag} variable.
This must match the combination of @var{bdpi} and @var{dpi} being used.
@item --destdir @var{string}
A directory name. If the directory is absolute, it is used as-is.
Otherwise, it is appended to the root destination directory set in the
script.
@end table


@node Installation testing 
@subsection Installation testing

@cindex testing, post-installation
@cindex installation testing

Besides the tests listed in @ref{Simple installation}, you can try
running @samp{make check}.  This includes the torture tests (trip, trap,
and mptrap) that come with Web2c (@pxref{Triptrap,,, web2c, Web2c}).


@node Security
@section Security

@cindex security considerations

None of the programs in the @TeX{} system require any special system
privileges, so there's no first-level security concern of people gaining
illegitimate root access.

@cindex trojan horse attack
@flindex .rhosts@r{, writable by @TeX{}}
A @TeX{} document, however, can write to arbitrary files, e.g.,
@file{~/.rhosts}, and thus an unwitting user who runs @TeX{} on a random
document is vulnerable to a trojan horse attack.  This loophole is
closed by default, but you can be permissive if you so desire in
@file{texmf.cnf}.  @xref{tex invocation,,, web2c, Web2c}.  MetaPost has
the same issue.

Dvips, Xdvi, and @TeX{} can also execute shell commands under some
circumstances.  To disable this, see the @samp{-R} option in @ref{Option
details,,, dvips, Dvips}, the xdvi man page, and @ref{tex
invocation,,, web2c, Web2c}, respectively.

@cindex local cache of fonts
@cindex cache of fonts, local
Another security issue arises because it's very useful---almost
necessary---to make arbitrary fonts on user demand with @code{mktexpk}
and friends.  Where do these files get installed?  By default, the
@code{mktexpk} distributed with Kpathsea assumes a world-writable
@file{/var/tmp} directory; this is a simple and convenient approach, but
it may not suit your situation because it means that a local cache of
fonts is created on every machine.

@cindex globally writable directories
To avoid this duplication, many people consider a shared, globally
writable font tree desirable, in spite of the potential security
problems.  To do this you should change the value of @code{VARTEXFONTS}
in @file{texmf.cnf} to refer to some globally known directory.
@xref{mktex configuration}.

@cindex append-only directories and @code{mktexpk}
The first restriction you can apply is to make newly-created directories
under @file{texmf} be append-only with an option in @file{mktex.cnf}.
@xref{mktex configuration}.

@cindex group-writable directories
@cindex setgid scripts
Another approach is to establish a group (or user) for @TeX{} files,
make the @file{texmf} tree writable only to that group (or user), and
make @code{mktexpk} et al.@: setgid to that group (or setuid to that
user).  Then users must invoke the scripts to install things.  (If
you're worried about the inevitable security holes in scripts, then you
could write a C wrapper to exec the script.)

@cindex file permissions
@cindex permissions, file
The @file{mktex@dots{}} scripts install files with the same read and
write permissions as the directory they are installed in.  The
executable, sgid, suid, and sticky bits are always cleared.

@cindex directory permissions
@cindex permissions, directory
Any directories created by the @file{mktex@dots{}} scripts have the
same permissions as their parent directory, unless the
@code{appendonlydir} feature is used, in which case the sticky bit is
always set.
