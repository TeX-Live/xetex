@ Synchronization is achieved with the help of an auxiliary file...
@y
@ Synchronization is achieved with the help of an auxiliary file named
`\.{{\sl jobname}.synctex}' ({\sl jobname} is the contents of the
\.{\\jobname} macro), where a {\sl Sync\TeX} controller implemented
in the external |synctex.c| file will store geometrical information.
This {\sl Sync\TeX} controller will take care of every technical details
concerning the {\sl Sync\TeX} file, we will only focus on the messages
the controller will receive from the \TeX\ program.

The most accurate synchronization information should allow to map
any character of the input source file to the corresponding location
in the output, if relevant.
Ideally, the synchronization information of the input material consists of
the file name, the line and column numbers of every character.
The synchronization information in the output is simply the page number and
either point coordinates, or box dimensions and position.
The problem is that the mapping between these informations is only known at
ship out time, which means that we must keep track of the input
synchronization information until the pages ship out.

As \TeX\ only knows about file names and line numbers,
but forgets the column numbers, we only consider a
restricted input synchronization information called {\sl Sync\TeX\ information}.
It consists of a unique file name identifier, the {\sl Sync\TeX\ file tag},
and the line number.
 
Keeping track of such information,
should be different whether characters or nodes are involved.
Actually, only certain nodes are involved in {\sl Sync\TeX},
we call them {\sl synchronized nodes}.
Synchronized nodes store the {\sl Sync\TeX} information in their last two words:
the first one contains a {\sl Sync\TeX\ file tag} uniquely identifying
the input file, and the second one contains the current line number,
as returned by the \.{\\inputlineno} primitive.
The |synctex_field_size| macro contains the necessary size to store
the {\sl Sync\TeX} information in a node.

When declaring the size of a new node, it is recommanded to use the following
convention: if the node is synchronized, use a definition similar to
|my_synchronized_node_size|={\sl xxx}+|synctex_field_size|.
Moreover, one should expect that the {\sl Sync\TeX} information is always stored
in the last two words of a synchronized node.

@ By default, every node with a sufficiently big size is initialized
at creation time in the |get_node| routine with the current
{\sl Sync\TeX} information, whether or not the node is synchronized.
One purpose is to set this information very early in order to minimize code
dependencies, including forthcoming extensions.
Another purpose is to avoid the assumption that every node type has a dedicated getter,
where initialization should take place. Actually, it appears that some nodes are created
using directly the |get_node| routine and not the dedicated constructor.
And finally, initializing the node at only one place is less error prone.

@ @<Initialize bigger nodes with {\sl Sync\TeX} information@>=
if s>=medium_node_size then
begin
  MISSING IMPLEMENTATION: update the synctex information for node at mem[r] with size s
end;

@ Instead of storing the input file name, it is better to store just an identifier.
Each time \TeX\ opens a new file, it notifies the {\sl Sync\TeX} controller with
a |synctex_start_input| message.
This controller will create a new {\sl Sync\TeX} file tag and
will update the current input state record accordingly.
If the input comes from the terminal or a pseudo file, the |synctex_tag| is set to 0.
It results in automatically disabling synchronization for material
input from the terminal or pseudo files.

@ @<Prepare new file {\sl Sync\TeX} information@>=
synctex_start_input; {Give control to the {\sl Sync\TeX} controller}

@ @<Prepare terminal input {\sl Sync\TeX} information@>=
synctex_tag:=0;

@ @<Close {\sl Sync\TeX} file and write status@>=
synctex_terminate(log_opened); {Let the {\sl Sync\TeX} controller close its files.}

@ Synchronized nodes are boxes, math, kern and glue nodes.
Other nodes should be synchronized too, in particular math noads.
\TeX\ assumes that math, kern and glue nodes have the same size,
this is why both are synchronized.
{\sl In fine}, only horizontal lists are really used in {\sl Sync\TeX},
but all box nodes are considered the same with respect to synchronization,
because a box node type is allowed to change at execution time.

The next sections are the various messages sent to the {\sl Sync\TeX} controller.
The argument is either the box or the node currently shipped out.
The vertical boxes are not recorded, but the code is available for clients.

synctex_sheet(mag);

synctex_tsilh(this_box);

@ @<Record void list {\sl Sync\TeX} information@>=
  if type(p)=vlist_node then begin
      synctex_void_vlist(p,this_box);
    end
  else begin
      synctex_void_hlist(p,this_box);
    end;

synctex_kern(p,this_box);

@ @<Record |math_node| {\sl Sync\TeX} information@>=
synctex_math(p,this_box);

@ When making a copy of a synchronized node, we might also have to duplicate
the {\sl Sync\TeX} information by copying the two last words.
This is the case for a |box_node| and for a |glue_node|,
but not for a |math_node| nor a |kern_node|. These last two nodes always keep
the {\sl Sync\TeX} information they received at creation time.

@ @<Copy the medium sized node {\sl Sync\TeX} information@>=
MISSING IMPLEMENTATION: copy the synctex information for medium sized node at mem[r] from node at mem[p]

@ {\sl Nota Bene:}
The {\sl Sync\TeX} code is very close to the memory model.
It is not connected to any other part of the code,
except for memory management. It is possible to neutralize the {\sl Sync\TeX} code
rather simply. The first step is to define a null |synctex_field_size|.
The second step is to comment out the code in ``Initialize bigger nodes...'' and every
``Copy ... {\sl Sync\TeX} information''.
The last step will be to comment out the |synctex_tag_field| related code in the
definition of |synctex_tag| and the various ``Prepare ... {\sl Sync\TeX} information''.
Then all the remaining code should be just harmless.
The resulting program would behave exactly the same as if absolutely no {\sl Sync\TeX}
related code was there, including memory management.
Of course, all this assumes that {\sl Sync\TeX} is turned off from the command line.
