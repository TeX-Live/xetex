	Version 1.12 of the omfonts programs
	====================================
	     ( p r e l i m i n a r y )

This directory contains a new Web Version 1.12 of the Omega font conversion
programs ofm2opl, opl2ofm, ovf2ovp, and ovp2ovf.

After numerous bugfixes and with a slight modification of one algorithm the
programs are now able to process ofm_level=-1 (TFM/VF) as well as
ofm_level=0,1 (OFM/OVF) files.  A virtual font and the local fonts can have
any combination of these ofm levels.

Note, however, that all this is still somewhat preliminary.  In particular
the programs still lack the thorough checking of all input data done in
TFtoPL&Co and required to diagnose problems with faulty binary files.
