	* tex.ech: Implement -etex switch.

2004-12-19  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.mk (etexextra.c): Depends on etexdir/etexextra.h.

	* etex.mk (etex-check): Add TEXMFCNF=../kpathsea to the mltex
	test, so the right files are found when the installation is not
	yet done.  From Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>.

2004-10-12  Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* etex.ch: Fixed a bug in the revised glue rounding code
	(detected by Tigran Aivazian <tigran@aivazian.fsnet.co.uk>).
	Version 2.2, dated October 12, 2004.
			
2004-09-15  Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* etex.ch: Fixed a typo in TeX text, found by Giuseppe
	Bilotta <bilotta78@hotpop.com>.

2004-09-06  Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* etex.ch: Incorporated register recycling bug fix from Bernd
	Raichle <bernd@dante.de>.
	Final Version 2.2 (hopefully).

	* etrip/etrip.{fot,log,tex,typ}, etrip/etripin.log:

	"--progname=etex".

2004-08-26  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.fix: Include fix for register recycling bug from Bernd
	Raichle <bernd@dante.de>.

2004-08-25  Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* etrip/etripman.tex: Updated to Version 2.2

2004-08-21  Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* etex.ch: Version 2.2.

2004-08-20  Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* etexextra.in: Peter holds copyright now.
	
2004-08-26  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.version: Is from now on a generated file.

	* etexextra.in: renamed from etexextra.h.  The current e-TeX
	version is substituted from etex.version.  Variant of code
	supplied by Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>.

	* etex.mk: Added rules to extract current e-TeX version from
	etex.ch and insert into etex.version and etexextra.h.  Variant of
	code supplied by Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>.

2004-08-17  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.mk, etex.fix: Resurrected etex.fix, there is again a need
	to include late-breaking changes.

2004-07-29  Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* etex.ch: Somewhat rearrange mixed direction typesetting code
	in order to reduce interference between eTeX and pdfTeX change
	files.

2004-07-25  Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* etex.ch: Reorganize additional command codes for convert
	and last_item in order to reduce interference between eTeX and
	pdfTeX change files.

2004-07-23  Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* etex.ch, tex.ch[01], tex.ech: Reorganize handling of banner
	string in order to reduce interference between eTeX, pdfTeX,
	and web2c change files.

2004-07-22  Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* etex.ch: Reorganize handling of additional token types.
	This also fixed a bug in error context for additional token list
	parameters, introduced by their reorganization.

2004-07-21  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etrip/etripin.log: Update from Preter Breitenlohner.

	* etrip/etrip.tex: Update from Peter Breitenlohner.

	* etrip/etrip.fot: Update from Peter Breitenlohner.

2004-07-19  Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* etex.ch, tex.ch[01]: Reorganize handling of additional token
	list and integer parameters and e-TeX's additional penalties in
	order to reduce interference between eTeX, pdfTeX, and web2c
	change files.

	* etex.ch: Add a note that this file not only defines etex.web
	in terms of changes to be applies to tex.web, but in addition
	is used to define pdfetex.web.

	* tex.ech: Add a note that this file is used to construct the
	web2c change files for both e-TeX and pdfeTeX.

2004-07-17  Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* etex.ch: Towards etex-2.2: Adapt to TeX 3.141592; this is still
	somewhat preliminary; do_glue still needs to be adapted to the new
	glue rounding algorithm of TeX 3.141592.
	Incorporate bug fixes from etex.fix.

	* etex.ch0, etrip/etrip.{fot,tex}, etrip/etripin.log: Adapted
	to TeX 3.141592.

	* tex.ch1, tex.ech: Change the xmalloc_array calls to the `new'
	interface (from 2001-11-10).

	* etex.ch0, etex.ch1, etex.fix, tex.ch2: Removed.

	* etex.mk: Rewrite build rules for etex.{web,ch}, add
	etexdir/etex.mk and remove etex.{ch0,ch1,fix}, tex.ch2.

	* etex.version: add newline.

	* etrip/etrip.log, etrip.diffs: changed due to bug fix.

2004-07-14  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.fix: Add fix for typo on line 2737 of etex.ch.  From Peter
	Breitenlohner.

	* etexextra.h: Add BUG_ADDRESS.

2004-07-04  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.mk: Move the creation of the format-related links to
	format-related install rules; this seems to be a better place for
	them, as the links are pointless without the corresponding
	formats.  Make the install-*-pool rules depend on the pool file in
	question.

2004-07-03  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.mk: Set up the make rules so that if etex isn't built (by
	default) we do not forward from the general to the etex-specific
	rules.  But the etex-specific rules can be used.

	* etex.mk: Use $(TANGLE), $(TIE) instead ./tangle, ./tie to
	support cross-compiling.

2004-05-10  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.mk (install-etex-programs): Typo resulted in no etex binary
	being installed.

2004-05-08  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.mk (install-etex-programs): This rule didn't have a command
	attached, so etex didn't get installed.
	(install-etex-links): Dont install einitex, evirtex links.

	* etex.mk: Formats are now parked in a subdirectory of
	$(web2cdir).

	* etex.mk: Change the .efmt extension to .fmt.  One consequence is
	that we don't want to build tex.fmt, where we could safely build
	tex.efmt.

	* etexextra.h: .efmt -> .fmt.

	* tex.ech: .efmt -> .fmt.

2004-01-27  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.fix: The assignment to cur_val instead of cur_val_level
	would result in \lastnodetype getting confused about what type of
	value it was supposed to be.  Reported by Hartmut Henkel
	<hartmut_henkel@gmx.de>, fix found by Fabrice Popineau
	<Fabrice.Popineau@supelec.fr>.

2003-02-19  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.mk: Installation of formats is no longer done via
	install-data in this file, but just from the install-data ->
	install-dumps -> install-fmts in the main Makefile.  That way we
	can prevent automatic installation with a single change in that
	Makefile.
	(etex.p): Depend on tangle.
	(triptrap): Depend on etrip.
	(install-etex-data): Double-colon rule.
	(install-data): Combine with install-etex-data.

2003-02-17  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.ch1: Reduce to banner changes.

	* etex.ch0: Slightly extend the reverted bits here, so they can be
	cleared out of etex.ch1 and are now all in one file.

2003-02-16  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.ch1: Correct the banners, and revert a final few bits of
	TeX that use a variable that doesn't exist in e-TeX.

	* etex.ch0: TeX 3.141592 and e-TeX 2.1 require reconciliation.
	Revert some of TeX's code to 3.14159 to get e-TeX 2.1 to tangle.

	* etexextra.h: Update banner for 3.141592-2.1.

	* etex.mk (etex.web): Add etex.ch0 and etex.ch1 to build rules.

2003-02-15  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.mk: From klibtool to libtool.  Based on patches from Albert
	Chin-A-Young <china@thewrittenword.com>.

	* etex.mk: Changes to make e-TeX, in extended mode, the engine
	under LaTeX2e.

2003-02-07  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.mk: Reorganized to match the new Makefile.in.

2003-01-15  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* etex.mk (etestenv): Add LC_ALL=C to the etrip environment.

2002-10-11  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* tex.ch1: Settle on a text for the not-TeX banner.

2002-06-02  Olaf Weber  <olaf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

	* tex.ch0, tex.ch1: Changes to account for the banner changing
	when certain options are specified that make the program
	not-strictly TeX.

	* tex.ch2: Commented-out changes deleted.  These changes became
	active in tex.ch1.

Mon Feb 01 18:35:30 1999  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* Version 2.1 for Web2c Version 7.2

Thu Feb 19 18:03:12 1998  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* Version 2.0 for Web2c Version 7.2

Sat Aug 23 14:14:12 1997  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* Integrated e-TeX Version 1.1 into Web2c Version 7.0
	(by Karl Berry, as of Feb  7 1997.

	All e-TeX (and e-TRIP) source files as well as a Makefile fragment
	are in a separate directory: web2c/etexdir. This will certainly make
	it easier to switch to e-TeX Version 2.
