dnl Top-level configure for kpathsea-using programs.
dnl Our job is to run configure in the relevant subdirectories.
dnl
dnl Assumption: each program will create a c-auto.h that defines
dnl everything kpathsea needs.  We arrange this by including (at
dnl autoconf time) kpathsea/common.ac.
dnl 
dnl Consequence: we don't need to run configure in the kpathsea directory
dnl itself; we can just copy from a program directory.  We'll use the
dnl first one.
dnl 
AC_INIT(kpathsea/kpathsea.texi)

dnl These configure scripts won't work with anything else.
AC_PREREQ(2.13)

AC_PROG_MAKE_SET

dnl Because we include make/common.make.
AC_PROG_CC
AC_ISC_POSIX
AC_PROG_LN_S

dnl If we guessed the prefix in the subdirectories, it might guess
dnl differently than the prefix here, and that would cause confusion.
AC_PREFIX_PROGRAM(tex)

dnl Pass this down from the top level so that when the subprograms
dnl install kpathsea a command line value is propagated.
AC_PROG_INSTALL

dnl If the other programs ever acquire their own --with or --enable
dnl options, they must be added, so configure --help at the top level
dnl will show all the options.
