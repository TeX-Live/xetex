make -- this subdirectory contains Makefile fragments.

configure substitutes them for ac_include lines in Makefile.in.
(This is an enhancement to standard Autoconf; see aclocal.m4.)

------------------------

With the long overdue transition from autoconf-2.13 to autoconf-2.59+
this is handled as follows:

Each 'ac_include' in Makefile.in is replaced by 'kpse_include' and the
command 'AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])' in configure.in or configure.ac is
replaced by 'KPSE_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])'.

The macro KPSE_CONFIG_FILES (defined in kpse_inc.m4) uses standard
autoconf mechanisms to achieve the desired substitutions.
