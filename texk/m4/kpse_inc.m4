# KPSE_CONFIG_FILES(FILE..., [COMMANDS], [INIT-CMDS])
# ---------------------------------------------------
# Specify output files that are configured with AC_SUBST.
# In a first step, each input file is converted into an auxiliary file
# with all `kpse_include' directives resolved.
# In a second step each auxiliary file is passed to AC_CONFIG_FILES
# with the (optional) COMMANDS to be run after config.status creates
# the output file.
#
# Each FILE is specified as OUTPUT[:[INPUT][:[AUX]]], i.e., the syntax is
# similar to that for AC_CONFIG_FILES but the meaning is quite different,
# there is one unique INPUT for each OUTPUT.  If omitted, INPUT defaults
# to OUTPUT.in and AUX to OUTPUT.aux.
