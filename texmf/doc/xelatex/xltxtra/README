THE XLTXTRA PACKAGE v0.3b

This package provides a few small features that
are useful for XeLaTeX.

It loads the fixltx2e and etex packages and
patches a couple of other LaTeX commands:
 \-: for discretionary hyphenation with variable
     hyphenation characters, and
 \textsuperscript & \textsubscript:
     now use fontspec to access
     real superior/inferior characters,
 \emph: uses NFSS information to determine
     when to enter \eminnershape,
 \showhyphens: now works.

Defines logos \XeTeX and \XeLaTeX.

Defines the dubiously useful commands
 \vfrac - for vulgar fractions with fontspec
 \namedglyph - to access font glyphs by name

For more info see the documentation xltxtra.pdf.
