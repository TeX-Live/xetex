-------------------------
THE XLTXTRA PACKAGE v0.4

This package provides an ever increasing number of
small features that are useful for XeLaTeX.

It loads the fixltx2e and etex packages and
patches a couple of other LaTeX commands:
  \-: for discretionary hyphenation with variable
     hyphenation characters, and
  \textsuperscript & \textsubscript:
     now use fontspec to access
     real superior/inferior characters,
  \emph: uses NFSS information to determine
     when to enter \eminnershape,
  \showhyphens: now works,
  \verb*: now displays visible spaces correctly
  \begin{verbatim*}: ditto

The following packages are patched to correctly
display visible space within various verbatims:
  verbatim, moreverb, fancyvrb, listings

Defines logos \XeTeX and \XeLaTeX.

Defines the dubiously useful commands
 \vfrac - for vulgar fractions with fontspec
 \namedglyph - to access font glyphs by name
