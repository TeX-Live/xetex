------------------------
THE IFXETEX PACKAGE v0.2

This very simple package, for both Plain and LaTeX, defines
the \ifxetex boolean for testing whether the TeX-variant
XeTeX is being used for typesetting.

Also provides the \RequireXeTeX command which throws
an error if XeTeX is not the engine in use.
