_______________________
THE EU ENCODING(S) v0.1a

This package is the first release of the first step towards offering a
LaTeX font encoding based on unicode. XeTeX is the only engine currently
utilising it to the best of my knowledge. No macro support is offered (the
encoding is just a placeholder for now) but an EU1 Latin Modern encoding is
offered in order to access the OpenType versions of those fonts.

N.B. This will only work when xdvipdfmx is used as the output driver for
XeTeX; xdv2pdf (Mac OS X only) does not support OpenType fonts that aren't
installed in the system itself.

Example of use:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[EU1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\begin{document}
...
\end{document}

See the accompanying file <test-eu1lm.ltx> for a complete example.
