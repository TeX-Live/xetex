------------------------
THE XLTXTRA PACKAGE v0.2

This package provides a few small features that
are useful for XeLaTeX.

It loads the fixltx2e and etex packages, and
patches a couple of other LaTeX commands: \-
for discretionary hyphenation with variable
hyphenation characters, and \textsuperscript/
\textsubscript that use the fontspec to access
real superior/inferior characters. It also
provides a parameterised logos for \TeX,
\LaTeX and \XeTeX.
