;; This file implements the Output Style Specifiers for plain
;; makeindex (see manpage of makeindex 2.x) in conjuction with
;; TeX/LaTeX.
;;
;; The Input Style Specifiers of makeindex cannot de defined in a
;; `xindy' style file. Use an appropriate version of the program
;; `tex2xindy' which should be included with this distribution.
;;
;; Since `xindy' uses a different specification language than
;; makeindex and some of the command-line options of makeindex are now
;; only available as style-file commands, this file can only serve as
;; a template that produces the default-markup of makeindex. However,
;; it may be used as a starting point for further modification and
;; specialization.
;;
;; The following values are taken from the source of the makeindex
;; distribution (see file scanst.h and the manpage) for further
;; details.
;;

;; Define all attributes appearing in your document. Your attributes
;; are all encapsulators you use in your \index commands following the
;; vertical bar sign `|'. For example `foo' is the attribute in the
;; command \index{...|foo}. Here you specify the set of attributes
;; that appear in your document, the order in which they appear in the
;; index and which one superdes the other.
;;
;; Example: a) (define-attibutes (("default") ("bf") ("it")))
;;          b) (define-attibutes (("bf" "default")))
;;
;; The initial command is (change it accordingly):

(define-attributes ("default"))

;; The description of the location-classes.
;; Add more location classes as needed.

(define-location-class "arabic-page-numbers" ("arabic-numbers"))
(define-location-class "roman-page-numbers"  ("roman-numbers-lowercase"))
(define-location-class "Roman-page-numbers"  ("roman-numbers-uppercase"))
(define-location-class "alpha-page-numbers"  ("alpha"))
(define-location-class "Alpha-page-numbers"  ("ALPHA"))

;; The most frequently used cross reference class "see". Add more, if
;; necessary.

(define-crossref-class "see")
(markup-crossref-list :open "\see{" :close "}{}" :class "see")

;; In makeindex: page_precedence <string>  "rnaRA"
;; List all location classes appearing in your document.

(define-location-class-order ("roman-page-numbers"
			      "arabic-page-numbers"
			      "alpha-page-numbers"
			      "Roman-page-numbers"
			      "Alpha-page-numbers"
			      "see"))
