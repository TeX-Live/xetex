** BUGS to investigate:

- native-word hyphenation doesn't always reassemble words fully - e.g., Noori diacritic problem

- error message when using \XeTeXcharglyph with a non-native font

- font style identification in complex families (LM)


** FEATURES to consider:

+ \ifXeTeXfont\f -- implemented \XeTeXfonttype\f instead

- \ifXeTeXfontexists "name"

- \XeTeXfont\f = "name" [style "S"] [using ENGINE] [features "featurestring"] [at SIZE]
- \XeTeXfontname\f

- \XeTeXadjustfeatures "featurestring" (does this modify the font identifier globally? locally?)

- \XeTeXmathchar, \XeTeXmathcode, etc

+ \XeTeXglyphindex <name> (to look up index of named glyph in current font, 0 if absent)

+ make \tracinglostchars report missing Unicode chars in native fonts

- vertical mode for OpenType/ICU fonts

- ability to adjust the font matrix (provides stretch, slant, baseline adjust, etc)

+ tracking (AAT-only, with font table support) and letterspace (any native font) features

- kerning overrides

- mechanism to load supplementary OT tables

- read AFM files if available with PFBs, and apply kerning

- Pango and/or Graphite as alternative renderers

- support one-of-many OT lookups (needs extension to feature syntax, and low-level support in ICU)

- update to latest ICU release
  - must check support for Syriac, Arabic supplement, Mongolian, Lao bug-fix

+ \pdfsavepos, \pdflastxpos, \pdflastypos (also \pdfpagewidth, \pdfpageheight)
