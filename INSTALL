INSTALL for XeTeX Snapshots

This distribution is essentially a stripped-down version of 
the TeXlive distribution with some additional libraries.

All source code is in the directory source; the build.sh
scripts will generate and populate a directory build.
 
The actual code of XeTeX is in source/texk/web2c/xetexdir
and its subdirectories.

* build.sh         builds a native xetex on your system
* build.sh --ppc   crosscompiles for osx-ppx from osx-intel
* build.sh --mingw crosscompiles xetex for mingw32 on i686-linux

XeTeX does not need a run-time pool file, and it locates
texmf.cnf based on its relative position in the TeX tree.

Post-compilation installation should be a simple matter 
of copying the executable to a normal place for web2c 
binaries and generating the desired formats.
