# Public domain.
# 
# The mktex.cnf file, if it exists, can be used to tailor a setup to
# local conditions.  If you use the mktex scripts, this file can contain
# generic Bourne shell code.  However, the C (and other possible future)
# implementations of the scripts do not handle anything beyond simple
# assignment of variables, and so doing more is not recommended.
#
# To assign variables, use constructs like the examples below, which only
# set unassigned variables.  The scripts may malfunction if you do
# otherwise.
#
# Some examples of what you can use the mktex.cnf file for:
# : ${MT_FEATURES=appendonlydir:varfonts}
# : ${MODE=ljfour}
# : ${BDPI=600}
# : ${ps_to_pk=gsftopk}
