The principal free @TeX{} distribution for Unix-like systems is @TeX{}
Live, on the web at @url{http://tug.org/texlive}.  The pages there
describe many ways to acquire @TeX{}, over the Internet or on physical
media, both the sources and precompiled binaries for many systems,
either standalone or as part of various operating system
distributions.

Web2C, Kpathsea, Dvips, and Dviljk are no longer released as a
separate packages.  Their sources are now maintained as part of @TeX{}
Live.

The host @t{ftp.cs.stanford.edu} is the original source for the files
for which Donald Knuth is directly responsible: @file{tex.web},
@file{plain.tex}, etc. However, unless you want to build your @TeX{}
library tree ab initio, it is more reliable and less work to retrieve
these files as part of a larger package. In any case, that ftp site is
not the canonical source for anything except what was created as part
of Stanford @TeX{} project, so do not rely on the other files available
there being up-to-date.
