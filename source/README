For a high-level overview of building TeX Live, see
http://tug.org/texlive/build.html.  In brief:

To configure and make the source tree, run ./Build.
To build (mostly) without optimization, run ./Build --debug.
To make without configuring, run TL_CONFIGURE=true ./Build.

(Nearly everything the Build script does can be overridden via
environment variables; just take a look to see all the names.)

Prerequisites:
- C and C++ compilers.

- GNU make.  If your GNU make is invoked by some name other than `make',
  try: env TL_MAKE=/your/gnu/make ./Build

- GNU clisp and GNU libffcall, for xindy.  See more
  details in utils/README.  (Alternative: Build --disable-xindy.)
  Also perl, latex, and pdflatex to build the rules and/or documentation.

- Perl to autodetect the TeX Live platform name for biber.

- X11 headers and libraries (often a ``development'' package, not
  installed by default), for pdfopen and xdvi.
  (Alternative: Build --without-x.)

- libfontconfig (again both headers and library), for XeTeX and xdvipdfmx,
  except on MacOSX.  (Alternative: Build --disable-xetex --disable-xdvipdfmx.)
  While on MacOSX, an Objective C++ compiler is needed for XeTeX.

- If you modify any .y or .l source files, then Bison and Flex (or maybe
  equivalents) are needed.  The distributed .c and .h files are generated
  with bison-2.5 and flex-2.5.35.

The binaries will be left in ./inst/bin/<stdplatform>.
For TeX Live, ignore the other files and directories that end up in ./inst.

The new binaries are not directly usable from that location.  Instead,
copy them to Master/bin/<tlplatformname>/.

That should be it for normal builds.  Email tex-live@tug.org if problems.

To make a usable TeX installation, you have to have (thousands of)
support files as well as the binaries that are built here.  The support
files are maintained completely independently.  The best basis for
dealing with them is the TeX Live (plain text) database,
Master/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb, and/or our installer.  More information is
under Master/tlpkg.  See also http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html.

If your C++ needs to find the standard library in, say, /usr/local/lib,
(i.e., configure fails saying the compiler doesn't work), try:
env LD_OPTIONS=-R/usr/local/lib ./Build

Many more details about the TL build system, such as adding new
programs or libraries, recompiling after fixing problems, etc., are in
the other README.* files here.

  (only the kernel is 64bit, the entire userland is 32bit.)

sparc-solaris
  OS: Sun Solaris 8
  compiler: Sun Studio 11
  bison (GNU Bison) 2.3
  flex version 2.5.4

    Because Solaris 8 does not include fontconfig, we used fontconfig
    package (version 2.3.2) from http://www.blastwave.org/
    (together with its dependencies)

    You can download fontconfig for AIX from
    http://www-03.ibm.com/servers/aix/products/aixos/linux/download.html

    - you have to set the ulimit high enough before compiling clisp and texlive
        ulimit -s 16384
      did suffice for me
    - compiling of texk/web2c/pdftexdir/writezip.c is broken and triggers a 
      compiler error with the above gcc. This is a known optimization error
      of gcc on alphas. The solution is to set
        LDFLAGS=-Wl,--no-relax
      before running Build.
    - compilation of clisp needs --disable-mmap
    - asy compilation with --disable-gsl && make
