For a high-level overview of building TeX Live, see
http://tug.org/texlive/build.html.  In brief:

To configure and make the source tree, run ./Build.
To build (mostly) without optimization, run ./Build --debug.
To make without configuring, run TL_CONFIGURE=true ./Build.
Email tlbuild@tug.org if problems.

(Nearly everything the Build script does can be overridden via
environment variables; just take a look to see the names.)

Many more details about the TL build system, such as configuring to work
on a single program, adding new programs or libraries, recompiling after
fixing problems, etc., are in the doc/tlbuild* document and the sibling
README* files here (which are generated from that document).


Build information for some of the platforms.

i386-linux: gcc 4.8.2, Linux 2.6.18-* (CentOS 5.10, tug.org:~karl/bin/mybuild)
  Except for dvisvgm, where we must use the system compiler (gcc 4.1.2,
  Red Hat 4.1.2-54) or libgs.so crashes trying to use gcc 4.8.2's
  libstdc++.  On the other hand, the system compiler has an optimization
  bug that causes lcdf-typetools's tfm.test to fail, so it can't be used
  for everything.  Sigh.
        
x86_64-linux: gcc 4.8.2, libc 2.3.6, Linux 2.6.28.6
  
amd64-netbsd:
  gcc version 4.5.3 (NetBSD nb2 20110806)
  NetBSD/amd64 6.1.3
  TL_MAKE=gmake LDFLAGS='-L/usr/X11R7/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/X11R7/lib' ./Build

*-kfreebsd:  the builder says ...
  I do not have any native kfreebsd systems. The best way to build is
  to run a clean kfreebsd "userland" within a jail.  I am running Debian
  "stable" kfreebsd userland under a freebsd 10.0 real system. Thus, I
  produced 32bit i386-kfreebsd binaries above ("./Build").
  
  I also tried, but am planning on dropping, running Debian "stable"
  kfreebsd installed on a virtual machine via VirtualBox. Thus, I
  produced 64bit amd64-kfreebsd binaries above.
  
  I tested that the freebsd binaries will *not* run on a kfreebsd
  "userland" and the kfreebsd binaries will *not* run on a freebsd
  "userland". Whereas I would have thought them to be somewhat
  interchangeable, they are linked to libraries (ELF interpreter ld.so.1)
  and maybe others) that are to be found in different locations on the
  different systems.
  
i386-solaris, x86_64-solaris: Solaris 10.

i386-cygwin, x86_64-cygwin: gcc-4.8.2, cygwin-1.7.29.
  ./Build (with --enable-xindy for i386).

powerpc-linux (Debian Squeeze)
  Linux homer 2.6.32-5-powerpc64 #1 SMP Tue Mar 8 02:01:42 UTC 2011
  ppc64 Debian GNU/Linux 6.0
  (only the kernel is 64bit, the entire userland is 32bit)

sparc-solaris: gcc-4.5.0, Solaris 5.10 (Utah).

universal-darwin, x86_64-darwin: a menagerie of versions.
  See Master/source/mactexdoc.tar.xz.
