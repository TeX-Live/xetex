Changes to make to the API when we are forced to change it:

* add font table deletion function ptr so that the app doesn't have to
  manage a collection of font tables

Other stuff we should do

* Change logging generation id to be a magic extra user attribute. This allows for use within justification logging. Also add [ ] around the whoe log to bring the fragments together.
