@section @TL{} Mailing Lists

First, two common kinds of messages which should not go to any TeX Live list:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Package bug reports must go to the package author. @TL{} redistributes what
is on CTAN without changes.

@item
General @TeX{}/@LaTeX{} usage questions should go to one of general help
resources.  The @TL{} lists are for @TL{}  topics specifically.

@end itemize

@noindent The following mailing lists related to @TL{} are hosted on
@file{tug.org}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@url{tex-live@@tug.org} - bug reports, package requests, license issues, and
general @TL{} discussion of any kind.

@item
@url{tlbuild@@tug.org} - specifically about building the binaries from the
sources included in @TL{}, and additional custom binaries.

@item
@url{tldistro@@tug.org} - specifically about packaging @TL{} for complete OS
distributions.

@item
@url{tldoc@@tug.org} - specifically about the base @TL{} documentation and
its translations.

@item
@url{tlsecurity@@tug.org} - specifically for security-related reports.

@end itemize

@noindent You can (un)subscribe to each or peruse their archives via the web
interfaces listed above.
